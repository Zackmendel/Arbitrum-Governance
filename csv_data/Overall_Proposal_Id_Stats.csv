Category: Non-constitutional

## Abstract
tl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.

The Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.

The remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.

The Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.

## Motivation
On March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:
- Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains
- Control over the DAO treasury
- Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer
- All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts
- Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors

Full responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.

While there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.

The Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.

The DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

## Rationale
While the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.

1. Smart Contract Lockup:

The remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.

2. Operating Budget:

Below is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.

As this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.

- Operating Budget: Cost ($USD)
- General and Administrative: $16,000,000
- R&D: $9,000,000
- Technical Infrastructure: $5,000,000
- Events, Marketing & Communications: $6,000,000
- Total - Next Twelve Months: $36,000,000
- (50% $USD/50% $ARB)

*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.

This operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.

3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives

Any additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.

The Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.

In addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.

4. Transparency Reports

The Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.

The Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.

The financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.

In addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup).

Category: Constitutional - Process

## Abstract:
This document (“AIP-1.2”) proposes amendments to the Constitution, and The Arbitrum Foundation Amended & Restated Memorandum & Articles of Association (the “A&R M&A”) and Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) to (1) remove references to AIP-1, and (2) make other changes reflecting feedback from the community.

## Motivation:
AIP-1 set out critical aspects of governance and included key governance documents for the ArbitrumDAO, and The Arbitrum Foundation which referenced AIP-1 throughout: the ArbitrumDAO Constitution (the “Constitution”), the Bylaws and the A&R M&A. However, after vigorous community debate, AIP-1 did not pass.

## Rationale:
The Constitution is a foundational document that lays out the governance system and capabilities of the ArbitrumDAO; the Bylaws and A&R M&A outline The Arbitrum Foundation’s relationship with and obligations to the ArbitrumDAO. These documents should be updated, via amendment, to remove references to AIP-1 and also to reflect other changes requested by the community during the debate process over AIP-1.

## Specifications:

1. Amendments to the Constitution ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link))
- Remove references to AIP-1, except as reference to the moment the original Constitution became effective.
- Make explicit that proposals to amend The Arbitrum Foundation’s A&R M&A and Bylaws take the form of a Constitutional AIP.
- Make explicit that the DAO may make a Non-Constitutional Funding AIP with respect to the Administrative Budget Wallet.
- Lower the threshold number of Votable Tokens required for an AIP to be posted on-chain from 5,000,000 $ARB to 1,000,000 $ARB.
- Add a new Section 5, which details the Data Availability Committee, including processes for removing and appointing Data Availability Committee members.

2. Amendments to the Bylaws ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link))
- Remove references to AIP-1.
- Clarify that the definition of “Administrative Budget Wallet” includes all assets that are contributed to or otherwise acquired by the Administrative Budget Wallet, inclusive of assets specifically approved by the ArbitrumDAO. As pointed out by the DAO in its feedback in response to AIP-1, the “Administrative Budget Wallet” defined term in the Bylaws was unclear and didn’t clearly reflect the reality of The Arbitrum Foundation’s receipt of 7.5% of the token supply upon the $ARB token genesis.
- Remove references to “Special Grants” and replace with the concept of Arbitrum ecosystem growth.
- Remove “AIP Threshold” defined term as it is not used elsewhere in the Bylaws
- Clarify that the ArbitrumDAO may replace The Arbitrum Foundation’s directors, change the number of directors, and require The Arbitrum Foundation to take certain actions.

3. Amendments to the A&R M&A ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link))
- Remove references to AIP-1.

## ATTENTION:

This is an updated version of a similar proposal that has been put up for a vote a day prior to this one. We have discovered that the target vesting contract in the previous proposal had an incorrect ""start"" date. A more detailed explanation is provided below. Please do not vote on the other proposal and vote on this proposal instead.

### What happened?

The way this proposal works is that there is a special AIP smart contract (AIP1Point1Target) that references the location of the vesting vault for the Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet. The on-chain action that the proposal is executing is changing of the “passed” parameter on this AIP smart contract from false to true, documenting DAOs approval for the Foundation to use this referenced vesting vault, after the vote the Foundation will move 700M ARB tokens that are subject of AIP 1.1 to this contract and will be able to retrieve the vested amount to the Foundation’s multisig. 

One parameter of this setup is a “start” timestamp, which determines the point in time from which the vesting schedule is being calculated. According to the text of AIP-1.1: “…ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO…”. So this timestamp should be set to 1681754400, which translates to Monday, 17 April 2023 18:00:00 GMT, the date of the Snapshot approval. However, in the vesting contract that was subject to the original vote, it has been wrongly set to the date of the ARB Airdrop (1679590871, which translates to Thursday, 23 March 2023 17:01:11 GMT). This means that the smart contract configuration did not reflect the text of the AIP and would result in the effective unlocked vested amount being too large.

### Resolution

Since we cannot cancel the vote at this point (it could be canceled by the Security Council, but only after the vote has passed), after thorough discussion, we have decided to create a new proposal with the correct smart contracts that are referenced in the vote. We recommend that the DAO ignore the other AIP-1.1 vote, and instead vote on this one.

If you’d like to check the parameters are set correctly this time, you can check (for example using Arbiscan) the AIP smart contract referenced by this vote: [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9E43f733Da0445b35f038FB34a6Fb8C2947B984C#code](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575). In the Contract tab you can go to the Read contract sub-tab and check that the arbitrumFoundationWallet parameter references smart contract at [0x15533b77981cda0f85c4f9a485237df4285d6844](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x15533b77981cda0f85c4f9a485237df4285d6844), which is the vesting vault. You can now go to this smart contract and, again, go to the Contract tab, and Read as Proxy sub-tab to see that the “start” parameter is set correctly to 1681754400. 

We hope that this resolution will cause as little confusion as possible among delegates. We plan to publish ""lessons learned"" from this case at a later date to elaborate on this case and suggest certain procedures to be implemented in the future to minimize the chances of such mistakes happening again.

### Abstract

tl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.

The Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.

The remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.

The Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.

### Motivation

On March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:

- Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains
- Control over the DAO treasury
- Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer
- All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts
- Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors

Full responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.

While there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.

The Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.

The DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

### Rationale
While the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.

1. Smart Contract Lockup:

The remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.

2. Operating Budget:

Below is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.

As this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.

- Operating Budget: Cost ($USD)
- General and Administrative: $16,000,000
- R&D: $9,000,000
- Technical Infrastructure: $5,000,000
- Events, Marketing & Communications: $6,000,000
- Total - Next Twelve Months: $36,000,000
- (50% $USD/50% $ARB)

*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.

This operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.

3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives

Any additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.

The Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.

In addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.

4. Transparency Reports

The Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.

The Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.

The financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.

In addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup).

**Title** 

Proposal: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova

**Author** 

Jason Windawi, Alchemy

**Type** 

This is a Constitutional proposal.

**Abstract** 

As part of the broader development of account abstraction standards and tooling, Ethereum researchers have proposed a new RPC [endpoint](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` that adapts L2 sequencers to the specific needs of ERC-4337 bundlers. Offchain Labs has contributed to this new method by developing, testing and incorporating adjustments necessary to support the endpoint for Arbitrum’s sequencer into Nitro with v.2.0.14, which is now live on the Arbitrum testnet. This AIP proposes that the Arbitrum DAO activate support for this endpoint on the One and Nova mainnets.

**Motivation** 

[EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) has created significant momentum for account abstraction across the EVM ecosystem. Among other innovations, the proposal split validation and execution into distinct steps in the process of bundling transactions for submission to an alternative mempool. This split introduced a potential issue for bundlers working on their L2 transactions.The delay between simulated transaction validation by the bundlers, and the final inclusion by sequencers, introduces a risk for reverting bundle submissions. This is due to the lag between the initial submission of a transaction and its ultimate inclusion, during which a smart contract account’s storage can change and invalidate the transaction. Reverted bundle transactions result in lost value for the bundler, discouraging operation of these services until the issue is addressed.

Ethereum researchers [developed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint to address this issue. This endpoint adds new options to the standard eth_sendRawTransaction endpoint that allow users to specify valid ranges for block height and timestamps. This will allow sequencers to reject transactions that don’t meet conditions for inclusion during the earlier validation stage, addressing the risk that in-account storage might change between validation and execution.

Offchain Labs developed, tested and implemented a version of the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint in the v.2.0.14 [update](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.0.14) to Nitro, and have since implemented the endpoint on the Arbitrum testnet. This proposal requests that the DAO approve activating this endpoint for Arbitrum mainnets.

**Rationale** 

This proposal directly supports the DAO’s constitutional value of maintaining alignment with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint was [developed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) by the Ethereum Foundation to address the proposal’s implications for layer 2 sequencers. Variations of this endpoint are being actively explored and developed by [prominent EVM L2s](https://blog.oplabs.co/erc-4337-and-account-abstraction/) [and others](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/700) in the ecosystem, indicating that the need for this endpoint in the context of sequencer/bundler interactions is a known problem with the need for active work toward a solution.

Our proposal is also aligned with the DAO’s objective of ensuring decisions are sustainable over the medium and long term. As Arbitrum continues to push toward [decentralization](https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/arbitrum-the-next-phase-of-decentralization-e7f8b37b5226) beyond Vitalik’s second [milestone](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), the need for a flexible and secure endpoint for 4337-compliant transactions on Arbitrum will only become more critical.

Finally, the proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s values of social and technical inclusion. By enabling one of the core features of account abstraction, Arbitrum’s ecosystem would have access to the enormous potential for improvements in UX and other benefits of account abstraction.

**Specifications** 

PR # [1474](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1474) on Github provides a history of the development and testing done by Offchain Labs, as well as the multiple stages of review by the team before it was merged on April 11, 2023. Making the endpoint viable for Arbitrum entailed two key adjustments to the checks performed before transactions reach the sequencer. The most fundamental was a config value change to the load balancer. The protocol’s load balancer has historically limited the computational costs of processing transactions by setting the number of acceptable slots in a transaction to zero. The new endpoint’s [design](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) allows for up to 1,000 slots. To accommodate this increase for conditional transactions, PR 1474 removed this 0 restriction for Nitro and for the testnet.

Allowing conditional transactions also introduces a risk of DOS attacks spamming the protocol with transactions regardless of whether they meet the state conditions at the time they were submitted. To address this, Labs updated the Arbitrum sequencer’s pre-check to incorporate a backward-looking validity check of a given account’s state, meaning that transactions can only execute if they met their own conditions as of one second prior to submitting the transaction.

**Steps to Implement**

The work already done by Offchain Labs on this endpoint means that the steps to implement this AIP reduce to changing the load balancer config value as described above.

**Timeline** 

Ideally ASAP, or as soon as is practical for Offchain Labs.

**Overall Cost**

The upfront costs for implementation should effectively be zero given the work done already by Offchain Labs.

Author Saurabh, Questbook

Type Non-Constitutional

### **Abstract**

- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/) , a community-run grants program.
- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants
- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*
- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/) ) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.


### **Motivation**

As we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members

## **Rationale (Benefits to Arbitrum)**

The proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:

1. Aligned allocation of funds: By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.
2. Increased transparency: The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.
3. Increased accountability: With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.
4. Lower Turnaround Time (TAT): The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours. The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.
5. Strong Brand Recognition : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas.

### Specifications

The program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.

**Steps to Implement**

**Arbitrum Grants Committee**

The program will consist of

1. A Program Manager
2. 4 Domain Allocators
![](https://i.imgur.com/uIjprH3.png)

We propose [Tally’s Zodiac Governor Module](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/questbook-arb-dao-grants) for security purposes, furthermore, a Grants SAFE with a 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and four domain allocators, one member from the DAO. We will then have four SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/4 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, one more domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.

**[Questbook ARB DAO GRANTS](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/questbook-arb-dao-grants)** acts as a security layer for grants multisig, empowering ARB holders to control multisig when needed.

Currently, we have four signers on the Safe, and the Safe is 3/4  until the domain allocators are elected by the community. As a result, we will have three temporary signers:

1. Saurabh - Program Manager
2. Frisson - Arbitrum Delegate 
3. Coinflip - Arbitrum Delegate
4. Matt Stable Labs - Arbitrum Delegate

Here’s the multi-sig address: [0xB7c1551BBEB47Eb86266153df5F9D7dA47F08308](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0xB7c1551BBEB47Eb86266153df5F9D7dA47F08308)

We have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.
![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0wompF.png)

### Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:

The following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.

1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed
2. Program Manager:
    1. Communication:
        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs
        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum
        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders
        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements
        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly
        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program
        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls
        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program and progress each selected project such as:
        
![](https://i.imgur.com/IAmytlJ.png)

2.  Grants Program: 
  a. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities
  b. Sign the transactions for the approved projects
  c. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision
  d. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly    distributed and take their feedback consistently

1. Domain Allocator:
    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator
    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager
    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network
    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.

### **Compensation:**

The grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unused funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qz3RmPL.png)

**P.S** 

We are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Tally, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted. 

## **What does success look like?**

Objective

1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.
2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects
3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas
4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)
5. Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)
6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum’s community call
7. Increased engagement in builder community’sDiscourseDiscord, TelegramSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)GitHub

Subjective

1. Improved community involvement in the grants program
2. Strengthened builders’ sentiment towards Arbitrum
3. Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition in builder circles

# Motivation

We are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow its ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “We can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today

The Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.

# Rational

A Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds"".

At its core, the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefit the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.

The programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming-specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.

Our approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.

Milestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.

During the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.

Once this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.

We have observed that many previous grants programs have struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:

- Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas
- Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO
- Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”
- Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and  Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community
- Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions

The selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:

- Previous experience delivering grants programs.
- Domain expertise and knowledge
- Ability to source innovative grants projects and support in the maintenance of a healthy pipeline of grants submission
- Maturity of program-specific processes and tooling
- Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of the mechanism
- Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values
- This is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.

With this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.
This is not a payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to match the funding pools of programs willing to run on Arbitrum. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users who might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into the support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.

Funding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.



# Improved Accountability, Transparency, and Reporting
Improved Accountability, Transparency, and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model. Web3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spending. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well as specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.

By using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand-alone grant environments.

By doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.

Grant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.

We know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.

- Frisson (6.59m)
 -Soby (5.33m)
- Coinflipcanda (4.95m)
- Nathan (680k)

**Plurality Labs**
- Disruption Joe
- Shawn Grubb

There are two layers of community protection against misuse or abuse of funds.

### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module

- DAO can clawback funds from multisig direct to its treasury with a vote
- Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers
### Grants Safety Multisig Signers

- A multisig protects from simple wallet hacks
- Protects from having the service provider hold all the funds
- Protects against obvious self dealing or abuse
- Provides a more integrated delegate watching the program closely
- Does not decide how funds are allocated - Only a signer
- This multisig is set up with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally. (Quorum is set at 100 million ARB for non-constitutional vote)

## Role of Signers and Governance 
The role of the multisig signer is solely to protect and prevent fraud and abuse such as perceived “self-dealing” by Plurality Labs. They are not expected to actively participate in deciding where funds should be allocated.

This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program.

During our sessions with the community, we learned that there is not an expectation of any election or term limits for this multisig because it does not actively make any decisions. Instead the requirements should be large delegates (skin in the game), active (will actually sign in timely manner), and has reputation (wants to maintain positive impression).

***This vote will enable the DAO at any time to set term limits or request elections and for that request to be executed within 30 days. Governance requests for the Grants Safety Multisig will only require a winning vote on snapshot which meets non-constitutional quorum.***

## Plurality Labs Payment
Upon receipt of 3.36 million ARB, the Grants Safety Multisig will send 30% of the Plurality Labs service fee to the Plurality Labs wallet: arb1:0x76Ae3Af25332F5cd01c312E281685Bb35D7d27eA

The remaining 70% will be streamed to the Plurality Labs wallet over a period of 6 months. This means that if the DAO believes Plurality Labs is performing poorly, they can even clawback the payment to Plurality Labs.

We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.

# Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3
The overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.

Prior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures… The same process will occur before Milestone 3.

Milestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. By the end of Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for the entire process to run autonomously onchain.

## Milestone 3 - Completion of the full project
We expect this to take 18 months in total. Each milestone being a 6 month cycle of iterative improvement. At the end of the third milestone we will provide:

### Metrics
- The number of quality active developers building on Arbitrum is growing at an increasing rate. (The combination of a quality assessment and the nuance of an increasing rate of growth indicates healthy and sustainable growth.)
- Voter participation is increasing as indicated by # of active ARB holders in participating in grants governance. (Participation, especially those buying ARB to participate, is a key indicator of ARB value as a governance token providing political decentralization.)
- DAO delegates’ satisfaction with Plurality Labs service is improving as measured by NPS. (The delegate’s happiness with Plurality Labs service indicates success as viewed by the delegates.)

### What will have been achieved?
- Capture-resistant governance of the grants program which supports continuous and sustainable funding of the grants program going forward.
- Ability to massively scale allocation amounts such that the DAO can comfortably allocate significant capital to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem by improving sourcing pipelines, standardizing evaluation models, and using multiple allocation methods appropriately aligned to outcomes.
- Improvements in the DAOs ability to sense, make and drive impact and outcomes by bringing the right information to the right decision making apparatus in a way that cuts off poor performance and doubles down on high-impact work.

# Voting Options
- Yes, fund Milestone 1 (3.36 million ARB)
- No, do not fund Milestone 1
- Abstain

# Proposal: Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit
**Category: Constitutional - Process**

* Disclaimers:
1. The text changed slightly since snapshot (becuase of L2Beat's forum comment)
2. This proposal and the attached executable were created by the Arbitrum Foundation *

## High Level Overview
The ArbitrumDAO Constitution specifies that the first Security Council election should start on the 15th September alongside a specification for the election.

An on-chain implementation of the entire election is still a work in progress. The Arbitrum Foundation has sponsored the implementation of a smart contract suite by Offchain Labs, an extension of Tally’s user interface, and the respective audits.

This proposal seeks to revise the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to provide flexibility for the start date of the election. If passed by a Constitutional Vote, the new start date will be on the 15th September or the earliest possible date in which an on-chain election can begin.

The motivation to change the election’s start date is to provide time for the implementation to be completed, security audits to be performed, for the community to gain confidence in the quality of its implementation and for the Arbitrum DAO to vote on a separate Constitutional AIP to install an on-chain election system.

The overarching goal is to still allow the election to begin on the 15th September, but it is prudent to provide leeway and ensure all parties, especially the Arbitrum DAO, are confident in the election software’s security and completeness.

## Path to a Smart Contract Enabled Election
This proposal seeks approval from the Arbitrum DAO that the first and all subsequent security elections should be performed via the on-chain election process.

The activation of the Security Council election is dependent on:

- Complete implementation for the on-chain smart contracts,
- Complete implementation of the user interface,
- Smart contract audit by a highly regarded auditing firm,
- All parties, including the Arbitrum DAO, have gained confidence in the implementation’s completeness and security,
- Successful Constitutional Vote by the DAO to install the new election software.

A vote on this proposal is approving that the above conditions are mandatory for any election software before it can be installed into the on-chain smart contracts.

## Modified Start Date for Election
The implementation sponsored by the Arbitrum Foundation should be ready for the start date of the 15th September.

Even so, given the naunces of implementation details and the potential security risks to a critical part of the system, we believe it is still prudent to provide leeway and extra time for the Security Council elections to begin some time after the required date set out by The Arbitrum Foundation.

After all, it is not just about having a complete implementation, but ensuring all parties have confidence that all efforts have made been to minimize the risk of bugs in the implementation.

###  Revision to ArbitrumDAO Constitution
The revised text focuses on the election beginning at the earliest possible date from the 15th September. Additionally, the election can only begin once an on-chain election system is installed via a separate Constitutional Vote.

All future elections can begin exactly six months after the previous election. As such, the chosen date for the first election will decide the earliest start date for the next election.

For extra clarity in the text, we have renamed “September Cohort” to “First Cohort” and “March Cohort” to “Second Cohort”

Finally, to remove any ambiguity, all security council members are expected to serve the time until the new Security Council members are installed in the respective smart contracts.

### Current text of ArbitrumDAO Constitution:

> The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into a September Cohort of 6 members, and a March Cohort of 6 members. Every year on September 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 September Cohort seats; and every year on March 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 March Cohort seats.

> This means that the initial September Cohort will serve an initial term of 6 months, whereas the initial March Cohort will serve an initial term of 1 year.

> The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the September Cohort and 6 members in the March Cohort. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report 


### Proposed Revision of Arbitrum Constitution:

> The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.

> The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report here.

> The first security election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that was approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the ‘First Cohort’. The next election replaces the ‘Second Cohort’ and so forth.

> The date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has started and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.

> All Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.


## AIP 4 executable code

This document explains how to create a governance proposal, which can trigger an [AIP action contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x85792f6BF346e3Bfd3A275318aDd2c44A1058447#code). 

The AIP can be created in https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/create

To go through the [governance lifecycle](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#proposal-lifecycle), the proposal's executable code must first trigger a L2 to L1 transaction through the ArbSys precompile.

For AIP 4, the `Arbitrum Core` should be selected since this is a constitutional proposal. 

Target contract address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064`

Disclaimer:
This proposal and the attached executable were created by the Arbitrum Foundation

# **Security Council Elections**

## **Category: Constitutional - Process**

As part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:
* [Section 3 of the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) describes this council in more detail.
* [Initial Setup Transparency Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup) details the current members of the council.
* [Section 4 on the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections) outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.

The first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.

### **Executive summary**
* This vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.
* A smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and has undergone multiple security audits.
* This vote is meant to enable the smart contract system that will allow for the elections, as well as temperature check with the DAO.
* A successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader [Arbitrum governanc architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/4f0714cf3651a9ebcddd5bb05b2f841314845c34/docs/overview.md).

### **Implementation Status**

The code representing the proposed architecture is final and available for full review in:
https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/commit/46dd56f55f4e0d96548fb6546122d47623c7a804.

The work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched, the full audit report is available [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/6413778294037033c56a25f32ef766c302544a9b/audits/trail_of_bits_sec_council_elections_report_8_9_2023.pdf).

A Code4Rena audit competition has also been completed for the election system.

# **Background**

An overview of the election process as described by the Constitution
alongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum's smart
contract suite:
* [Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) (esp. sections [3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) and [4](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections)) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.
* [DAO Governance Architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md) - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.

An understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the
reader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:
* [Open Zeppelin Governor](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-security-council-elections-proposed-implementation-spec/15425) - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.
* [Gnosis Modules](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-docs/blob/e5a669fa66a32aa4fc2ef84b219bc836e9328f6b/safe-core-protocol/plugins.md) - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.

# **High-level Election Overview**

The Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.

The proposed election implementation, which must adhere to [the specification laid out in the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections), is split into:
* Election stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.
* Update stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.

The election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:

### **Election Stages**

Process for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.

1.  Nominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.
2.  Compliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.
3.  Member election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.

### **Update Stages**

Process to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.

1.  Security Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.
2.  L2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.
3.  Individual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.


# **Election Stages in detail**

## **1. Nominee selection (7 days)**

This stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration,
candidate endorsement:
* Election creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.
* Candidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.
* Endorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.
* Fallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.

### **Implementation details**

The nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.

It inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:
* Custom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.

The governor contract has the following characteristics:
* A new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.
* Candidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.* Delegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.

## **2. Compliance check by the Foundation (14 days)**

The Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organization being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).

### **Implementation details**

The foundation can exclude a nominee by:
* Calling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.

The Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.

Once the compliance check has completed:
* Anyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.

If there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.

## **3. Member election (21 days)**

The voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.

The voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:
* 0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token
* 7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.

Additionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:
* Split voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.

### **Implementation details**

The Security Council member election will take place in a separate
SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit
from Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.

After the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can
trigger a new member election:
* Call the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor

The SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:
* A custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.
* These additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.
* The custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.

At the end of the 21 days of election:
* Anyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.

# **Update stages in detail**

## **1. Security Council manager update**

The security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.

The manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:
* Remove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.
* Add a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member
* Address rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members.

### **Implementation details**

The manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.

Calling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.

## **2. Timelocks and withdrawal**

Constitutional DAO proposals all pass through:
* L2 timelock (3 days),
* L2 → L1 withdrawal (\~7 days),
* L1 timelock (3 days).

You can read more about these stages in the [governance docs](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#proposal-delays). The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.

### **Implementation details**

The existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.

The SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.

## **3. Individual council updates**

The new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis
safes:
* Arbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council
* Arbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council
* Ethereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council
* Nova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council

The old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will
replace them.

### **Implementation details**

To do this the existing [Upgrade Executor contracts](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#l1-upgrade-executor) on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom [Governance Action
Contract](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/src/gov-action-contracts/README.md) will be used to call the specific OwnerManager `addOwnerWithThreshold` and
removeOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.

## **Additional affordances**

The Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties

1.  The DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favor and 5/6 of cast votes are in favor. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.
2.  The Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.
3.  The Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.

## **Constitution Updates**

The proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution's text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.

Note, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.

### **Update timeline for the election**

The Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:
* From T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.
* From T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.
* At T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.

We need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:
* **New timeline.** A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.
* **Less than 6 eligible nominees.** The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.
* **Installation time.** We need to remove the phrase 'immediately join the Council' to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user's right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 -\L1 message.

With the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the
Constitution with the following text:
* **Nominee selection (T until T+7 days):** Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.
* **Compliance process (T+7 until T+21 days):** All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.
* **Member election (T+21 until T+42 days):** Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.
* **At T+42 days:** The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.

### **Compliance checks by the foundation.**

The Constitution contains the text:
* ""Prior to the next Security Council election, The Arbitrum Foundation shall establish and set forth more detailed procedures and guidelines regarding the election process for the Security Council, which may include, but aren't limited to, a candidate intake process in order to comply with Cayman Islands laws, a standard template for candidates to complete for purposes of their public nominations and other processes to ensure an orderly, fair and transparent election.""

The text gives an affordance to the Foundation to conduct a compliance check on the potential nominees. We propose to make this check an explicit stage of 14 days between Nominee Selection and Member Election to allow the Foundation to conduct these checks. Details of compliance checks will be provided by the Arbitrum Foundation at a later date.

We propose to update the Constitution with the following text:
* The Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.

**Security Council cannot re-appoint a member who was removed by the DAO.
**
The Constitution contains the text:
* The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election.

The text focuses on how to replace a security council member who was removed by a vote from the DAO or 9/12 of the current security council members. We plan to update the Constitution to remove an edge-case that allows the Security Council to re-appoint a member who was removed by a DAO vote.

We propose to update the Constitution with the following text:
* The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election. The Security Council may not re-appoint a member removed and they must be re-elected via the election voting system.

### **Final update to the Constitution text.**

For completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:

The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.

The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the \'First Cohort\' and 6 members in the \'Second Cohort\'. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmcny9xqHG9s9HduycwpooW4sV9VUMxYtVwU2eBts7vyYq).

The first Security Council election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that is approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the \'First Cohort\'. The next election replaces the \'Second Cohort\' and so forth.

The date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has started and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.

All Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.

The following timeline governs an election that starts at time T:

1.  **Nominee selection (T until T+7 days):** Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.
2.  **Compliance process (T+7 until T+21 days):** All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.
3.  **Member election (T+21 until T+42 days):** Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+21 days and T+35 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+21 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.
4.  **At T+42 days:** The process for replacing the cohort of security council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new security council members are installed.

The Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The
Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.

As a matter of best practice for maintaining an independent Security Council, no single organization should be overly represented in the Security Council. In particular, there should not be more than 3 candidates associated with a single entity or group of entities being elected to the Security Council, thereby ensuring that there will be no single entity or group of entities able to control or even veto a Security Council vote.

Furthermore, no candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO, Governed Chains and/or The Arbitrum Foundation should be elected to the Security Council. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited to, affiliations with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others.

The DAO may approve and implement a Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future Security Council elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.

Security Council members may only be removed prior to the end of their
terms under two conditions:

1.  At least 10% of all Votable Tokens have casted votes \""in favor\"" of removal and at least 5/6 (83.33%) of all casted votes are \""in favor\"" of removal; or
2.  At least 9 of the Security Council members vote in favor of removal.

The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election. The Security Council may not re-appoint a removed member and they can only be re-elected via the election voting system."

# AIP-7: Arbitrum One Governance Parameter Fixes

## Non-Constitutional 

## Abstract
Three independent issues have been identified in the Arbitrum One Governance system and the current proposal aims to address them. Given this is maintenance of the system, after the forum discussion period it will skip the Snapshot temperature check and go directly for an on-chain vote.

## Specifications 

### 1. Updating the airdrop distributor fee sweep address to the DAO Treasury’s address

The Arbitrum DAO airdrop was distributed to users via the [TokenDistributor contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x67a24CE4321aB3aF51c2D0a4801c3E111D88C9d9). The recipients are able to claim their tokens until the Ethereum block #18208000 (estimated to be created on the 24th September 2023).

After the claim period is over, unclaimed leftover tokens may be swept over to the specified sweepReceiver address, which is currently set to the [L2 treasury timelock](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses). Per the [Governance Architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#overall-configuration) documentation, this should be set to the [DAO Treasury’s address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58).

**Fix:** 
Call the the 'setSweepReciever()' function on the TokenDistributor contract, and include the [DAO Treasury address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58) as the _sweepReceiver(address).

### 2. Sequencer gas fee reimbursement parameterization

The Arbitrum One sequencer pays the necessary gas fees for posting user transactions to Ethereum. This is done through transactions to the Sequencer inbox.

The sequencer gets reimbursed for these fees in Arbitrum One. The reimbursement is calculated by ArbOS, but two parameters are currently incorrectly configured.

1. The Sequencer Inbox has a fixed cost associated with including a transaction. The value is currently configured to 100000 Ethereum L1 gas units - this can be viewed in the ArbGasInfo precompile through the getPerBatchGasCharge function. If you inspect transactions live in the system (sample from [June 15th](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xd2eb2dea13148ac8080544cd4eb1df27ad984055760609b23664a54d6e3e24c4/gas-usage) and [July 17th](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xe11e940a8e0e21c3092bf1785438351348d333a751f658838f0a90dc27813058/gas-usage)), it is possible to see that the fixed cost of including a batch is actually much closer to 240000 Ethereum L1 gas units.

2. The ArbOS L1 pricing system features an optional “amortization cost cap” which is intended to subsidize the fixed posting cost for chains with low activity or AnyTrust chains whose fixed cost is much larger than other data posting costs. This feature was not intended to be enabled on Arbitrum One. As such, the cap was set to its maximum value, 2^64 - 1 (this can be viewed in the ArbGasInfo precompile through the getAmortizedCostCapBips function). However, this did not fully disable the cap. As visible in the code, the amortization cap is only disabled with a value of 0. With the cap set to its maximum value, but still enabled, the cap would prevent the L1 pricer from taking into account the cost of multiple batches posted in the same L1 block. That’s because it would consider the costs of all but the first batch as having a weight of zero, because no time passes since the previous batch if the batches are in the same L1 block. Setting the amortization cap to 0 fixes this issue by bypassing the previously linked if statement to fully disable the amortization code.

The combination of these two issues add up to gas funds being incorrectly charged to end users, thus not fully reimbursing sequencer operations. This fix will increase fees for users but they will now reflect the actual costs of the system - it is expected to be a minor difference.

**Fix** 
➡️ Transaction to [ArbOwner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070#writeContract) precompile calling setPerBatchGasCharge(int64) with the intended value '240000'.

➡️ Transaction to [ArbOwner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070#writeContract) precompile calling setAmortizedCostCapBips(uint64) with the intended value '0'.

### 3. L1 Core Governance Timelock scheduleBatch Bug

When executing a batch of operations on the [L1ArbitrumTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6841D92B0C345144506576eC13ECf5103aC7f49), if more than one operation creates a retryable ticket (i.e., more than one operation targets an L2 chain), the full msg.value value will be forwarded to each one. If not properly constructed, this can lead to retryable tickets that fail to get created. While there are workarounds, the current implementation is error-prone and the fix allows for more graceful creation of several L1 to L2 operations.

**Fix**
Upgrade the implementation of the [L1ArbitrumTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6841D92B0C345144506576eC13ECf5103aC7f49) with the change [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/86/files#diff-93cdc770d0b61d15d694632048ac3aa46ff9dd5fa5bfae6b1310568b2e1df187).

The fixes were implemented through Governance Action contracts and can be viewed on the [Governance codebase](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/tree/7d6f4dac06ab98eaa0a4bef9c0dc09a9af6d67fd/src/gov-action-contracts/AIPs/MiscAIP).

# AIP: Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration Proposal [2nd Revision]

This is an amended draft proposal by the RARI Foundation, addressing community feedback.

## Abstract 

The Rari Foundation is submitting a proposal to jumpstart the growth in the Arbitrum NFT ecosystem. The proposal involves integrating Arbitrum One with the open-source Rarible protocol, which is an indexer, orderbook and SDK powering NFT-based applications, which, once integrated, can be freely and easily used by the Artbitrum builders. 

## Motivation 

The Arbitrum ecosystem is hard for independent developers to build NFT-based applications due to a lack of easy-to-use tooling and infrastructure. Without this support, the developer community will be opting for other chains with more robust support for building.

Optimism vs Arbitrum NFT stats as of July 27, 2023 indicate Arbitrum is not the first choice for the creation of NFT assets or contracts. Source [NFT Scan](https://arbitrum.nftscan.com/).

The open-source Rarible Protocol is specifically focused on the NFT use case and will enable builders to develop their next dapps choosing Arbitrum, resulting in bringing in new Arbitrum users and sequencer revenue. 

The Rarible Protocol is a trusted choice as it’s community governed, has an easy-to-use API, a comprehensive SDK, and is committed to expanding its capabilities to power innovative NFT use cases. Furthermore, the Protocol is used by Rarible.com NFT marketplace, whose brand and community can be leveraged in raising awareness about Arbitrum venturing deeper into NFT tooling. Such signaling to the market will show that the Arbitrum community is serious about growing its ecosystem and flourishing NFTs. Rarible and the Rari Foundation will promote the integration in a cross-marketing push to ensure the NFT and crypto community knows that Arbitrum is serious about NFT growth. This support will consist of (and shall not be limited to): 
- Regular features on Rarible.com top spotlight section (1 million MAU)
- Dedicated social support for the launch on Rarible’s and Rari Foundation's owned channels (Twitter, Instagram, Discord, 800k+ followers combined)
- Email blasts for the integration (500k+ subscribers)
- Leveraging Rarible's and Rari Foundation's press relations
- Potentially a hackathon

This proposal is being submitted outside of the pending grants framework, in order to implement the integration asap, as waiting for the grants framework would result in significant implementation delays. As such, the Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to express its willingness to incentivize ecosystem growth via strategic partnerships.

## Rationale 
 
The proposed AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values by enhancing the utility, scalability, and inclusivity of the Arbitrum network. The Rarible Protocol, a decentralized toolset for NFT applications, is open-source and free, mirroring Arbitrum's commitment to technical inclusivity and neutrality.
By integrating Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol, we empower developers to create more complex and innovative applications on Arbitrum. This integration increases accessibility to real-time and historical Arbitrum blockchain data, aligning closely with Arbitrum's commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity. 

## Key Terms

**The Rari Foundation:** The legal entity for the Rari DAO community that is in possession of $RARI Treasury and on the path of possession of the Rarible protocol

**Rarible Inc.:** A leading NFT marketplace that allows users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. One of the applications using the Rarible protocol.

**Rarible Protocol:** Open-source, free-to-use, community-governed Protocol (which includes an SDK, indexer and orderbook) for the creation, transaction, and distribution of NFTs.

**Rarible SDK:** A part of the Rarible protocol that provides a set of tools for developers to interact with multiple blockchains

A few notes on the [Rarible Protocol](https://rarible.org/):

- It is an open-source, EVM-based SDK and multichain indexer that currently powers 4,000+ NFT marketplaces (including Rarible.com), and a series of non-marketplace-based applications (like wallets and NFT analytics services - see more use cases [here](https://docs.rarible.org/use-cases/use-cases-overview/)). 
- Designed as a set of building blocks, the Rarible protocol empowers the creation of fully customized NFT experiences of any level and complexity. ️
- API access is lightning-fast, unified, and comprehensive. You gain seamless access to NFT Items, Collections, -Activities, and NFT Metadata across multiple blockchains, including ETH, POL,  IMX, FLOW, TEZ, to name a few —all consolidated within a single endpoint.
- The protocol’s indexer is the fastest on the market. It retrieves blockchain data through fast APIs, eliminating the need for your own indexer and reducing costs associated with maintaining Blockchain Nodes. 
- User-friendly SDK allows you to seamlessly connect wallets, mint NFTs, put them up for sale, purchase NFTs, showcase collections, and so much more.  The Protocol is the feature-rich product on the market (you can do anything NFT related on our Protocol).
- Comprehensive Marketplace Support: Our platform offers unrivaled support for various marketplaces, providing access to aggregated orderbooks from major platforms like OS, LR, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and Tezos, so you can ensure your users have access to the most competitive listings in the market.

## Specifications 

Below is a detailed breakdown of how the integration will take place and the platforms and technologies that will be used. 

### Rarible Protocol: Integrating Arbitrum One

The Rarible Protocol is a decentralized toolset that allows developers to build NFT applications. It includes smart contracts, an indexer, an SDK, and APIs. The integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol will extend these capabilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem, enhancing its utility and inclusivity.

- Rarible Arbitrum SDK
    - The Rarible SDK will expedite Arbitrum application development. By extending the SDK to support Arbitrum One, we will provide developers with tools for interacting with smart contracts, supporting NFT operations like minting, transferring, and burning, and integrating with multiple wallets.
- Rarible Orderbook & Smart Contracts
    - Our contracts, specifically the Rarible Exchange V2, will be deployed to the Arbitrum chain, granting access to our off-chain order book. Certain actions such as canceling, confirming, updating, or when price changes occur, are on-chain but the creation of orders is off-chain.
- Rarible Public API
    - With the integration of Arbitrum One, the API will offer extended support for these chains, allowing developers to easily access and interact with NFT data on Arbitrum.
- Rarible Arbitrum Indexer
    - Rarible’s multichain Indexer will be able to track and record NFT events on Arbitrum, providing developers with a comprehensive view of NFT activities on Arbitrum.


## Steps to Implement 

### Arbitrum One integration into Rarible Protocol 

The first key milestone will be integrating Arbitrum into the Rarible Protocol, which will set the foundation for future milestones involving building NFT applications on Arbitrum.

**Tasks: Integration of Arbitrum One chain into Rarible Protocol**

- **Arbitrum API Integration:** This task involves integrating the Arbitrum API into the Rarible Protocol API to support Arbitrum One.
- **Node Preparation:** A separate node for Arbitrum will be set up for rapid indexing upon approval 
- **Contract Deployment:** The Rarible Shared NFT, Rarible Factory (for creating collections), and Rarible ExchangeV2 contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum for users to interact with.
- **Orderbook:** Rarible’s orderbook will be able to store listings, orders, and bids made with the protocol
Arbitrum Indexer: Index NFT contracts, ERC-721/1155, ERC-20 tokens, Exchange orders & bids (from Seaport & Rarible).
- **Arbitrum support on Rarible Multichain SDK:** This involves adding a new blockchain, connectors to wallets, and ensuring functionality similar to ETH/Polygon.
- **Debugging and Testing:** General debugging of all components will be conducted, along with testing on production with OpenSea orders.
- **Build Testnet for Arbitrum:** An additional environment for the testnet will be set up, including indexing, reindexing, etc.


## Timeline 

The tentative timeline consists of 7 weeks in total, 5 of which are the integration phase. If the proposal is approved by early September 2023, the project implementation can be executed in early Q4 2023. 

## Overall Cost 

As the integration of the Rarible Protocol and Arbitrum will benefit both ecosystems, we are offering to split the Rarible Protocol integration costs between our two parties with an equal share.

### Integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol
**Duration:** 5 Weeks  
**Costs:** 200,000 $ (Artibtrum portion = **100,000 $**)

**Payment terms:**

50% payable upon proposal approval

50% payable upon completion (identified as the release of Rarible's protocol integration to Arbitrum, with the API up and running, contracts deployed, NFTs are queryable)

The 100,000 USD amount is payable in ARB under the exchange rate on the day of the proposal submission. As of Sept 13, the rate is 1 ARB = $0.785339, which translates to 127,351 ARB.

Note that the Rari Foundation will absorb costs related to the service and maintainance of the Protocol upkeep after the integration implementation.

Note: This proposal has been drafted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a one-time, community-created consensus framework to distribute up to 50,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through January 31, 2024. 

Granted funds are expected to be distributed by the end of January 31, 2024. Participating grantees will be expected to self report data, dashboards, and summarize grant performance on an ongoing basis.

## Motivation

This provisional framework aims to allow delegates to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed ([1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/4-arbitrum-open-governance-call-26-07-2023/15559), [2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-now-a-pragmatic-approach-for-the-moment/15779), [3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/quit-shooting-the-dao-foundation-in-the-foot/15771/2), [4](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116)).

The goals of the framework are to:

* **Support Network Growth**: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.
* **Experiment with Incentive Grants**: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
* Find new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.
* Create Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.

## Rationale

By incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.

Given that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.

## Specifications

The Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.

Following a successful [Snapshot Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5e0057920df9a278918e4de4ee1e6de7e2415d2af985e40a6c7a1a4b47a4ce01), the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply to delegates for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.

The Snapshot Temperature Check achieved consensus and approved funding of up to 50,000,000 ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.

## Financial Proposal

The Financial Proposal will comprise the following:

* A ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and [application template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544) as articulated in this document.
* Approval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.
* A 50,000,000 ARB distribution to the [STIP-ARB multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B).
* A 94,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.
  * 20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:
    * Draft and review of multiple iterations of the STIP framework.
    * Moderation of community calls and working group telegram.
    * Coordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.
   * 54,000 to ARB Multisig Signers (6,000 ARB per Signer).
   * 20,000 ARB to StableLab streamed weekly for organizing and highlighting applications and managing review processes. This includes:
        * Overseeing forum application and review stages.
        * Monitoring progression of applications throughout the application and review process.
        * Monitoring progression of applications throughout the application and review process.
        * Collaboration with the Foundation for forum setup and oversight.
       * Facilitation of Delegate x Grantee Community Calls during review periods.

**Multisig Setup**

The [STIP-ARB 5/9 multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B) is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes the signers from the original PL-ARB multisig with the addition of to three community members (pending KYC):

* Karel Vuong, Treasure DAO
* Jack Sanniota, 404 DAO
* Lindsey Winder, Hedgey Finance

This new multisig, the STIP-ARB multisig, includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:

1. Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.

2. Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, *not punish bad designs*.

## What are the Eligibility Requirements?

Grant Requirements:

* Grantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.
* Grantees must not farm their own incentive programs. 
* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant's objective.
* Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard .
* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.
* Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.
* Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.
* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.
* Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.
* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.
* Grantees must apply using the approved program application [template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544). 

By streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:

* Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.
* Failure to comply with data reporting standards.
  * Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.
    * Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.
    * More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.
  * If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.

In that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds. 

## Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines

Grants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.

Protocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there's no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.

As such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:

* Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)
  * Recommendations:
    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.
    * Meets one of the following criteria:
      * .> $1.5M TVL.
      * .>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.

* Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)
  * Recommendations:
    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.
    * Meets one of the following criteria:
      * .> $4M TVL.
      * .>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.

* Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)
  * Recommendations:
    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.
    * Meets one of the following criteria:
      * .> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.
      * .> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.

* Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)
  * Recommendations:
    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 12 months
    * Meets one of the following criteria
      * .> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL
      * .> $200M 30D cumulative volume

One could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.

# Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?

Grants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.

### Cycle 1

1. Application Period (1 Week):

During the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application [Template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544).

Once posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.

2. Review Period (1 Week):

Delegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.

Applicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.

3. Voting Period (1 Week):

A delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.

To succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.

### Cycle 2

Repeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.

# Overall Cost
50,094,000 ARB.

# Outstanding Questions and Concerns

**What happens if the budget is exceeded?**

We do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 50M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated based on the amount of votes in favor of a proposal, and then on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.

**What will happen to excess funds?**

Following Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.

**What is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?**

The Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of empowering delegates to process incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.

At the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.

**How does the program determine whether to halt funding streams?**

Funds can be stopped by the STIP-ARB Multisig with a 5/9 consensus. Funds will be stopped in the event of negligent actions in violation of the previously defined grant requirements. If halted, the multisig must publish the justification of its decision on the Arbitrum Forum. The stream can restart either through a Snapshot Veto or if the multisig decides the grantee has corrected their actions and it’s appropriate to continue.

**What are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?**

* **Community Support**: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.
* **Network Activity**: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.
* **Community Awareness**: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.
* **Incentives Data**: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.


***Regarding the StableLab Engagement** StableLab has offered to handle management of the forum process starting September 22, 2023 and has agreed to accept back pay (from the proposal's passing) via weekly streams forward through January 31, 2023. This arrangement was initiated due to their proactive outreach regarding a competitive rate and interest under unique time-constraints and circumstances. If at any point the multisig feels StableLab has not upheld diligence in its responsibilities the multisig is empowered to halt the stream and appoint a new service provided by election. 

Further, due to these last-minute circumstances, the DAO is entitled to elect competitive service providers during the first voting round by signaling a competitive offer in this proposal thread. If a counteroffer(s) is endorsed by a delegate with over 500,000 ARB VP the DAO will hold an election for the remainder of the contract length (endorsement to avoid spam).

# Empowering STIP to measure the impact of incentives for new builders

[<img height=""500"" width=""500"" alt=""STIP_Backfund_Opportunity"" src=""https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/394a4797e0b4068e1290ae30aaf14db7e8b7ff72_2_500x500.jpeg"" />STIP\_Backfund\_Opportunity3374×3374 884 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/394a4797e0b4068e1290ae30aaf14db7e8b7ff72.jpeg ""STIP_Backfund_Opportunity"")

**Call to Action for Arbitrum ecosystem**

This proposal represents a critical opportunity for our community to:

* Support diverse, emerging builders and make Arbitrum a welcoming environment for new projects
* Double the sample size and diversity of stages and categories in the STIP data set
* Uphold constitutional values of Inclusion vs Exclusion
* Avoid potentially irreversible harm of crushing small, high potential builders

**Notes:**

* This proposal draft has been prepared by the Arbitrum STIP Inclusion Working Group following a series of community calls and workshops involving various stakeholders. As a preliminary document, it seeks input from both the Arbitrum DAO and the Liquidity Working Group.
* This proposal frequently cites AIP-9.
* For all of our resources see here: svy.gg/stip-backfund 

# Abstract

This proposal outlines a one-time backfund to all ""approved but not funded proposals’’ from Arbitrum STIP. The proposed AIP increases the total budget by 21.4M to 71.4M while increasing the total participating protocols by 26, for a total of 56 funded projects. The program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while leveraging distribution systems, consensus, and delegate diligence already created from STIP 1.

This program is designed to backfund approved protocols while maintaining the timelines and systems of STIP 1:

* Timeline: The program is scheduled to commence and conclude concurrently with STIP 1, or within a similar timeframe, starting from the first week of November and running through January 31, 2024.
* KYC: The program will utilize the same KYC system as STIP 1.
* Reporting: Participating grantees are required to self-report data, maintain dashboards, and regularly summarize grant performance

# Considerations

Before this proposal was drafted, a working group was formed to gauge sentiment, gather key data points, and outline the proposal’s structure. The working group collaborated with delegates and projects affected by the STIP, engaging in multiple calls—including sessions with the creators of the STIP and the Incentive Working Group—to solicit feedback and refine the proposal accordingly.

Key concerns discussed include:

### Why not just push towards a round 2 and go through voting for all proposals again?

First and foremost, we believe that the successful execution of this Backfund proposal will, in time, serve as a crucial catalyst for future grant structures, including a successful STIP round 2. Why? This opportunity will unify the Arbitrum ecosystem by addressing key weaknesses in the original STIP 1 structure by quickly providing approved projects and other stakeholders with the resources/data needed to design and support future programs.

Key issues associated with delaying an immediate backfund and moving towards a round 2 include:

* Proper design and execution add considerable time delay to a highly competitive environment within Arbitrum and other L2s
* Requires teams with limited resources approved already for STIP 1 to spend significant time lobbying delegates
* Removes attention away from new Round 2 proposals
* Adds additional burden to delegates that should be focused on long-term design improvements and new STIP grants not yet approved
* Removes key data for STIP experiment analysis by skewing learnings towards larger, well-established projects
* Delays the alignment of the STIP with the Arbitrum constitution values of inclusivity and diversity
* Negatively impacts new builder sentiment towards Arbitrum at a critical time in the L2 Wars

### The budget set aside was 50M, and the DAO decided that was the acceptable spend for a short-term incentive.

While the budget was set at 50M, the original working group proposed 75M so that:

> “The budget was raised to 75M ARB to accommodate larger protocols (Pinnacle Grants) without compromising smaller applications.” [tnorm, September 3rd 2023.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131/12)

Excess demand was a significant possibility due to the high interest in STIP and the absence of a cap for Pinnacle grants. Voters lacked the data to ascertain whether the initial 50M would be adequate to achieve the objectives of STIP.

Noteworthy is that, in the event of excess demand, measures including backfunding were already outlined as potential options.

Proper design and fulfillment of a Round 2 or similar future funding programs may take time to develop. Meanwhile, projects that received approval but no funding have immediate initiatives requiring support. Our opportunity is to fund these initiatives, level the competitive playing field, and enhance the data available for the STIP process.

### Voting behaviors for a 50M proposal shouldn’t carry over to a proposal that includes the additional backfunded amounts.

During our consultation process, we engaged in numerous discussions that brought forth questions about backfunding. Despite the criticisms, backfunding remains the most straightforward method to address the current STIP’s skewed sample size. We advocate that backfunding is the optimal approach to achieve the STIP’s intended outcomes—specifically, to examine the impact that incentives have on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Furthermore, if the STIP continues without rectifying the issues with its sample, the analysis will be compromised by a significant methodological flaw. Backfunding is not just the “best” option; it is essential for preserving the integrity of the STIP overall.

Voting behavior might have differed if the budget cap were set at 75M or 100M. The only way to determine this would be to repeat the experiment with a raised cap (an option that is unfeasible as time travel has not yet been realized).

It’s helpful for us to remember the original objectives of the STIP:

* To provide incentives to a diverse and inclusive group of Arbitrum projects.
* To quickly establish an incentives program that is in harmony with Arbitrum’s values and constitution.
* To generate robust, meaningful data to shape the future design of Arbitrum grants for projects of all types and sizes.

# Motivation

> Motivation - A statement on why the Arbitrum community should implement the AIP.

How can Arbitrum create an incentives structure to grow the ecosystem? STIP started when the community began investigating creative uses for incentives. A short-term program was devised to act quickly, collect data about how incentives are used by Arbitrum protocols, and learn from the results to design new programs and grow the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

An unexpected budget problem caused many successful STIP applications to receive no funding. The real-world consequence of this mistake caused the STIP sample to be cut in half - but not at random. To determine the final STIP cohort, the applications were sorted by approval, which inadvertently skewed the sample towards incumbent protocols. This sampling bias is most egregious for collecting data about the smallest protocols; over 70% of Beacon grants were rejected due to the sorting algorithm that was used. Consequently, STIP may not be collecting sufficient data about new builders on Arbitrum.

This AIP seeks to achieve STIP’s original motivations by:

1. nearly doubling the sample size;
2. adding protocols across a broad array of industry categories; and
3. including protocols at different stages of development.

This AIP will ensure an important builder population is included in the study, while increasing the validity of the STIP results.

One of the most important questions facing Arbitrum today is how to grow the ecosystem and win the L2 Wars. STIP is a novel study on the impact of incentives for growing the Arbitrum ecosystem. In practice, the STIP excluded most new builders from the study, severely limiting the data that will be collected about the early stages of the builder pipeline. This AIP includes a broader range of protocols in the STIP study, ensuring that Arbitrum gets the data it needs about how incentives impact new builders in the Arbitrum ecosystem. It stands to reason that extending incentives to smaller projects could serve to incubate projects that grow into the high-usage dApps of tomorrow. Extending the STIP may not only increase the inclusivity of the program but also incentivize significant growth for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem at a lower cost per project, and this possibility is worth exploring.

# Rationale

`Rationale - An explanation of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values`

Arbitrum’s community values highlight the importance of diversity, which increases the fitness of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem by representing the needs of many kinds of participants. The original work to design STIP was careful to consider how both large and small protocols would fare under the framework. However, the unexpected budget cutoff caused the sample to skew towards large protocols, which is at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community. The cost of falling short of this ideal is that STIP systematically overlooks the possibility that incentives might be uniquely interesting to small and new protocols. By failing to incorporate protocols at the first stages of the builders onboarding pipeline, Arbitrum will be unsure about how incentives operate among this crucial group of protocols.

The Arbitrum community also values neutrality, which received careful consideration during the STIP design stages. It was well-understood that incumbent protocols were likely to prevail with their STIP applications - but it was hoped this would not preclude smaller participants from also being funded. Unfortunately, this wish for inclusion was not fulfilled and - unintentional though it may have been - funding was nevertheless distributed according to a ranking that was likely to favor incumbents. Again, despite the best efforts of the DAO and the STIP designers, the result was at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community.

Above all, Arbitrum seeks to create and nurture a thriving ecosystem - and the DAO’s values are designed to provide guiding values that will always trend towards the health of the ecosystem. When the values aren’t met - even unintentionally - it is possible the best interests of the ecosystem aren’t met, either. In the case of STIP, accidentally excluding Beacon grants falls short of the community values - which, in all likelihood, is a critical oversight that Arbitrum would benefit from fixing.

**Abstract:**
This proposal recommends the allocation of 500,000 $ARB tokens, equivalent to 0.005% of the total supply, to acknowledge and reward the outstanding contributions of Arbitrum community members known as “Arbiters.” These contributors have played pivotal roles in Arbitrum’s development, from translation and publicity to community support and protection from fraudulent activity. By establishing a transparent and equitable reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, we aim to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication, fostering the growth of our ecosystem.

**Motivation:**
The Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:

1. Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum’s development.
2. Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.
3. Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.
4. Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.

**Rationale:**
The Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in **shaping Arbitrum over the past two years**. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.

**Partial contribution value**
Since 2021-2023, the work and contributions made by Arbiter are too numerous to list and quantify individually, and the data provided are statistically estimated due to the lack of prior targeted data counting and retention.

1. Provided millions of help to Arbitrum community users and developers. It allows Arbitrum team members to focus more on the development of technology, and also allows millions of Arbitrum community members to get answers to all kinds of questions and needs feedback. (Anyone can view the help and contributions of the arbitrators on the arbitrum Discord server, wechat groups, and other language communities, etc.)
2. Arbiters are online 24/7 (in Odyssey and Guild activities related to many arbiters are 16 + hours online, for community members to provide the most immediate, high-quality help) arbiter two years, has been involved in the maintenance and management of the community order, to report and stop more than 100,000 times of the scam, to ensure that hundreds of thousands of members of the community are able to get help in a timely manner and to keep the server safe.
3. Establish Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and other Arbitrum local communities, such as: Chinese more than 10 WeChat groups, WeChat public number, microblog, Coinhub, and other media (due to policy reasons, a number of Chinese media has canceled the account)The establishment of language communities has further expanded Arbitrum’s influence, attracted more than 100,000 users and developers to choose to use Arbitrum, and promoted the prosperity of the ecosystem.
4. Translate and proofread more than 50 Arbitrum articles, arbiters in various language areas edit, typeset and publish Arbitrum daily information more than 2,000 times, publish more than 300 articles and blogs, explain more than 50 videos, and all kinds of accounts with a large number of real fans and readers, for hundreds of thousands of users around the world to provide a quick understanding of the use of Arbitrum and the information and guidelines.
5. arbiter has provided community optimization, management, operation, and promotion suggestions for arbitrum more than 300 times, making the system of Arbitrum publicity, service, promotion, and operation more perfect, and allowing Arbitrum users, developers, and ecosystem projects to get better service experience and help.
6. dock 30 Arbitrum AMA, more than 20 events, more than 100 docking projects, affecting hundreds of thousands of community members, attracting more than 50 projects to choose an arbitrum network for deployment.
7. Some Arbiters have their own communities, and as KOLs in Twitter and famous communities, they vigorously promote Arbitrum through their own influence, posting blogs and all kinds of information, and their continuous influence involves hundreds of thousands of crypto community users. This has brought great enthusiasm and new users to the Arbitrum community.
8. arbiters has been accompanying and witnessing the prosperous development of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem, continuously carrying forward the spirit of the Arbitrum community and promoting and marketing Arbitrum.

From 6,400 wallet addresses at the initial mainnet launch to 1,270,000+ wallet addresses now, including the growth of on-chain TVLs and a thriving ecosystem. Helped and assisted Arbitrum Discord to grow from tens of thousands of members to now 460,000, providing millions of high quality help, all kinds of Arbitrum promotion and publicity with millions of views.

**Specifications:**

*Beneficiaries:*
Arbiters: Comprising the most dedicated contributors to the Arbitrum community over the past two years, recognized for their exceptional and humble service to the Arbitrum community.

*Distribution of Incentives:*
The Arbitrum community requests a total of 500,000 $ARB tokens, to be evenly distributed among 24 of its members, recognizing their past work for the Arbitrum community.

Calculation: 20,833.333 $ARB tokens per member x 24 Discord Arbiter = 500,000 $ARB

**Wallet Address Collection and Distribution:**
Arbiters’ contributor wallet addresses will be collected through a specified process, ensuring accuracy and fairness. If the proposal is approved, the Arbitrum DAO will disburse rewards to each Arbiter contributor’s address, following thorough verification and confirmation.

**Future Plans:**
Upon the successful implementation of this proposal, we will continue to enhance Arbiter contribution methods, ensuring the sustained growth of the arbitrum community.

arbiters will continue to translate blogs, do publicity, organize AMAs, hold offline activities, provide community suggestions, optimize community services, maintain community order, provide high-quality help to the community, actively connect with various activities and projects, and help promote cooperation with other communities. On the basis of arbitrum, actively participate in the arbitrum Ambassador Program and explore more ways to contribute, and continue to provide value to the broader arbitrum ecosystem.

Our goal is to continually contribute value to arbitrum and collaborate with the broader community to foster a vibrant and thriving arbitrum ecosystem.
As arbitrum continues to evolve, we will also be able to really demonstrate our knowledge of the protocol and help show more new users that arbitrum is the optimal scaling solution for Ethereum.

**Milestones**
When the arbitrum discord server exceeds 700,000 members,or when TVL passes $3b,or when we have helped community members more than two million times, or when we have made significant progress in various types of outreach and publicity. We are committed to transparently communicating milestone updates and displaying data about what arbiters are doing or contributing.

After this proposal, we will pay attention to the statistics and retention of examples of contributions made by arbiters, and data. This will facilitate more detailed examples and data presentation at the next milestone.

**Conclusion:**
The implementation of a robust reward system via the Arbitrum DAO is crucial for recognizing and appreciating the invaluable contributions of Arbiters to the community. This initiative will reinvigorate community engagement, foster openness, and encourage sustained participation, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum community. Transparency, fairness, and continuous improvement based on community input will be at the forefront of this endeavor. With this proposal, we are confident in building a more collaborative, innovative, and dynamic Arbitrum community that embodies the values and spirit of our ecosystem.

Your insights are valued and essential in shaping the future of our community. We welcome you to provide feedback and engage with us.

# AIP: ArbOS Version 11

# Constitutional

## Abstract

This AIP introduces a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including support for the EVM Shanghai upgrade and the PUSH0 opcode, along with miscellaneous bug fixes. These improvements are now audited and ready for adoption, including by Arbitrum Orbit chains, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal concerns the latter two, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hardfork - more can be read about the subject over in https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695

## Changes Included

### 1. EVM Shanghai support (including the PUSH0 opcode)

Recent versions of go-ethereum already includes support for the changes to the EVM made in the Shanghai L1 upgrade, but we need to enable them for Arbitrum chains. Instead of using a time based activation, it’s better to activate support based on the ArbOS version, which makes sure that even if the upgrade is delayed, Shanghai support will take effect uniformly and without causing divergences with out of date node software.

### 2. Retryable fixes

Retryable fees previously always used the network fee account, instead of also using the infrastructure fee account. The infrastructure fee account should be paid fees from the basefee, and the network fee account should be paid any surplus fees when the gas price is elevated. That was correctly implemented for normal transactions, but retryables only dealt with the network fee account. Retryable redemption also reported an incorrect gas usage in the block header. This matters to Arbitrum Nova, where the infrastructure fee account pays out some fees to the Data Availability Committee members, but the network fee account does not.

<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1980>

### 3. Fix the chain owner list returned by precompile

This change doesn’t affect the actual chain owner set, but the list being returned by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile was incorrect for Arbitrum Nova due to an internal ArbOS issue. To be clear, this does not affect who was able to make chain owner actions. As intended, only the DAO is able to make chain owner actions on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This change only affects the list of chain owners presented by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile.

PRs:
<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1525>
<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1768>

### 4. Fix some precompile methods taking up all gas when reverting

Some precompile methods such as ArbSys’s arbBlockHash method took up all gas when reverting. That meant that if a transaction called arbBlockHash with an out-of-range block number, it’d use up all the gas when reverting.

PR:
<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1490>

### 5. Create missing precompile methods to view some L1 pricing parameters

The L1RewardReceipient and L1RewardRate were previously not exposed via precompiles. This change adds methods to get them to ArbGasInfo so that the current chain configuration can be easily checked.

PR:
<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1775>

### 6. Fix the possibility of a staticcall from the owner to ArbOwner emitting a log

This shouldn’t matter in practice, but it was theoretically for a staticcall from the chain owner to the ArbOwner precompile to emit a log. In the EVM, staticcalls should never be able to emit logs. This PR fixes the Arbitrum precompile logic to disallow emitting logs in staticcall contexts.

PR:
<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1562>

### 7. Fix default L1 pricing params

This shouldn’t matter for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, because these parameters were already corrected in [AIP-7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-7-arbitrum-one-governance-parameter-fixes/15920). However, it’s included in ArbOS version 11 so that any Arbitrum Orbit chains automatically get the correct parameters.

PR:
<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1549>

## Implementation

The canonical version of ArbOS 11 this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash  `df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d`

That commit builds a WASM module root of `0xf4389b835497a910d7ba3ebfb77aa93da985634f3c052de1290360635be40c4a`, which is a hash of the code that’s put on-chain for fraud proofs. You can verify this WASM module root on a x86\_64 computer (i.e. not on ARM which builds slightly different symbol names) with Docker setup by checking out the previously mentioned commit of the nitro repository, running `git submodule update --init --recursive`, and then running `docker build . --target module-root-calc --tag wavm-machine && docker run --rm wavm-machine cat /workspace/target/machines/latest/module-root.txt` This uses Docker to perform a reproducible build of the WebAssembly code used in fraud proofs, and outputs its hash.

The above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwA1PK3AB9ggHMqaw91mubu5WHcEp398/view?usp=sharing>

### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference

The current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 10, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v10` git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x6b94a7fc388fd8ef3def759297828dc311761e88d8179c7ee8d3887dc554f3c3`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.

To audit the code difference from ArbOS 10 to ArbOS 11, you could simple generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 10 or ArbOS 11 with bash:

`#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
mkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output`

`# this script should be run in the nitro repository`

`git checkout df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d
git submodule update --init --recursive
make solgen
go list -f ""{{.Deps}}"" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '[]' | sed 's/ /\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find ""$dir"" -type f -name '*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '_test\.go`

Now, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 10 or 11. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:

`git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)`

For the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 10 and 11 used:

`$ git ls-tree consensus-v10 go-ethereum                                                                                                                                                                                           128 ↵
160000 commit 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298  go-ethereum
$ git ls-tree df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d go-ethereum
160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum`

Those commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:

`git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)`

This diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.10.25 and v1.11.6, as ArbOS 10 used the former and ArbOS 11 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: <https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf>

We can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 10’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.11.6:

`git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff
git diff v1.11.6 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff
diff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff`

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[ARDC]**

**Non-Constitutional**

*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*

**TL;DR**

* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.
* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));
* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:

1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.
2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.

* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;
* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;
* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.
* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.

**Background - Perspective**

The Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.

The Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.

This proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.

**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Why?]**

The Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

For instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.

The ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:

* Governance Proposals;
* Research;
* Framework Development;
* Risk Assessment;
* Secure Code Reviews;
* Threat Modeling; and
* Testing Enhancements.
* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives

In our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.

**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**

***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***

* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.
* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***

* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.
* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)

***Quantitative Assistance:***

* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.
* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.

***Project Management \[On a Request-Basis]:***

* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.

In addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:

***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***

* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.

***Research New Mechanisms:***

* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.

***Delegate Engagement:***

* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.

***Growth Initiatives:***

* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.

In summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**

The ***DAOAdvocate***

The DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.

If a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.

***The Risk Member***

The Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.

***The Security Member***

The Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.

***The Research Member***

The Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.

**Checks & Balances**

The ARDC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ARDC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.

The Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:

Appointment & Termination: ARDC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.

* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:

*“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \[*[*$1.10 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan 1*](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)*].*

* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:

*““ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at* [*The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3*](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) *(as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:*

*1.* [*Snapshot*](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) *(or any successor thereto); or*

*2. another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.*""

**Conflict of Interest Provision**: ARDC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.

To sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.

**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.

**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).

**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.

**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.

**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.

**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.

**Operational parameters to be implemented**

* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;
* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;
* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;
* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.

We believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Multi-Sig]**

The ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:

* Sam \[Gains Network]
* Matt \[StableLab]
* ImmutableLawyer \[Axis Advisory]
* Max \[Connext]
* Brian \[Gamma Strategies]

The ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:

* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.
* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Term]**

The duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums."

The primary mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is to oversee and facilitate the recently ratified procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as per the following reference: \[Snapshot Proposal Link: [Snapshot 4](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.
2. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.
3. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project’s eligibility for the ‘Subsidy Fund’ referred to in point \[b] above. This ‘Means Test’ (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in \[b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.
4. The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.
5. The ADPC will be tasked with creating & communicating guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes & circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.

The ADPC will be composed of three \[3] members that will facilitate & administer procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The appointment of ADPC members will be effected via an open election process via Snapshot’s weighted voting system; wherein the first three \[3] ranked members in the vote will be elected to the ADPC. Albeit not legally binding, when voting for prospective members of the ADPC, delegates & token holders alike should prioritize the following eligibility criteria so as to properly equip the ADPC to carry out its mandate.

**\[vi] FUNDING, TERM & OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS**

**FUNDING**

Elected members of the ADPC will receive a comprehensive compensation package as part of their service during their 6-month term. This package includes a monthly stipend of 7,500ARB to support them in their roles and responsibilities within the ADPC.

**TERM**

The duration of the ADPC’s mandate will be of 182 days \[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal that funds the ADPC is approved by the ArbitrumDAO.

**OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS**

* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;
* Monthly report detailing performance of the ADPC;
* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ADPC;
* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ADPC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.

We believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ADPC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ADPC progress. These dashboard will also grant applicants going through the procurement process insight into internal timelines & progress, thus ensuring a high degree of transparency operationally.

**ADPC \[Multi-Sig]**

The ADPC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:

* DisruptionJoe \[Plularity Labs]
* [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) \[Premia Finance]
* [@limes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/limes)
* [@KlausBrave](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave)
* Dan \[Vela]

The ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:

* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ADPC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.
* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.

**CHECKS & BALANCES**

The ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.

The Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:

Appointment & Termination: ADPC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.

* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:

“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \[[$1.38 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)].

* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:

“ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 1](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) (as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:

1. [Snapshot 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) (or any successor thereto); or
2. another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.

Conflict of Interest Provision: ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.

To sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.

Mandate & Purpose of the ADPC: The ADPC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ADPC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ADPC Mandate objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal.

Record-keeping and Reporting: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[ARDC]**

**Non-Constitutional**

*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*

**TL;DR**

* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.
* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));
* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:

1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.
2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.

* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;
* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;
* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.
* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.

**Background - Perspective**

The Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.

The Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.

This proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.

**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Why?]**

The Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

For instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.

The ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:

* Governance Proposals;
* Research;
* Framework Development;
* Risk Assessment;
* Secure Code Reviews;
* Threat Modeling; and
* Testing Enhancements.
* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives

In our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.

**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**

***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***

* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.
* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***

* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.
* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)

***Quantitative Assistance:***

* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.
* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.

***Project Management \[On a Request-Basis]:***

* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.

In addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:

***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***

* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.

***Research New Mechanisms:***

* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.

***Delegate Engagement:***

* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.

***Growth Initiatives:***

* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.

In summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**

The ***DAOAdvocate***

The DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.

If a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.

***The Risk Member***

The Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.

***The Security Member***

The Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.

***The Research Member***

The Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.

**Checks & Balances**

The ARDC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ARDC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.

The Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:

Appointment & Termination: ARDC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.

* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:

*“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \[*[*$1.10 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan 1*](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)*].*

* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:

*““ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at* [*The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3*](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) *(as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:*

*1.* [*Snapshot*](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) *(or any successor thereto); or*

*2. another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.*""

**Conflict of Interest Provision**: ARDC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.

To sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.

**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.

**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).

**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.

**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.

**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.

**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.

**Operational parameters to be implemented**

* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;
* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;
* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;
* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.

We believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Multi-Sig]**

The ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:

* Sam \[Gains Network]
* Matt \[StableLab]
* ImmutableLawyer \[Axis Advisory]
* Max \[Connext]
* Brian \[Gamma Strategies]

The ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:

* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.
* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Term]**

The duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums."

2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.

* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;
* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;
* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.
* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.

**Background - Perspective**

The Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.

The Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.

This proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.

**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Why?]**

The Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

For instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.

The ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:

* Governance Proposals;
* Research;
* Framework Development;
* Risk Assessment;
* Secure Code Reviews;
* Threat Modeling; and
* Testing Enhancements.
* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives

In our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.

**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**

***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***

* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.
* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***

* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.
* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)

***Quantitative Assistance:***

* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.
* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.

***Project Management \[On a Request-Basis]:***

* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.

In addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:

***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***

* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.

***Research New Mechanisms:***

* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.

***Delegate Engagement:***

* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.

***Growth Initiatives:***

* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.

In summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**

The ***DAOAdvocate***

The DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.

If a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.

***The Risk Member***

The Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.

***The Security Member***

The Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.

***The Research Member***

The Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.

**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.

**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.

**Operational parameters to be implemented**

* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;
* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;
* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;
* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.

We believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Multi-Sig]**

The ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:

* Sam \[Gains Network]
* Matt \[StableLab]
* ImmutableLawyer \[Axis Advisory]
* Max \[Connext]
* Brian \[Gamma Strategies]

The ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and members elected:

* Streaming of funds to elected members through Hedgey on a monthly basis. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote as the ArbitrumDAO will be made the Grant Admin on the Hedgey module.
* Clawback capability as explained hereunder.

**The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ARDC Multi-Sig via the Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ARDC \[Clawback Capability]:** [**Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \[Clawback Capability\] 1**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)

**In addition, after the ARDC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ARDC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.**

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Term]**

The duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums."

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[ARDC]**

**Non-Constitutional**

*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*

**TL;DR**

* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.
* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));
* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:

1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.
2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.

* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;
* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;
* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.
* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.

**Background - Perspective**

The Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.

The Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.

This proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.

**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Why?]**

The Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

For instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.

The ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:

* Governance Proposals;
* Research;
* Framework Development;
* Risk Assessment;
* Secure Code Reviews;
* Threat Modeling; and
* Testing Enhancements.
* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives

In our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.

**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**

***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***

* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.
* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***

* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.
* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)

***Quantitative Assistance:***

* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.
* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.

***Project Management \[On a Request-Basis]:***

* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.

In addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:

***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***

* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.

***Research New Mechanisms:***

* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.

***Delegate Engagement:***

* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.

***Growth Initiatives:***

* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.

In summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**

The ***DAOAdvocate***

The DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.

If a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.

***The Risk Member***

The Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.

***The Security Member***

The Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.

***The Research Member***

The Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.

We propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)]. Hereunder, we propose an adapted model of Section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to implement to the ARDC Elections.

The ARDC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the ratification of the on-chain proposal.

The date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has been finalized.

All ARDC members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ARDC \[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions].

There will be four separate elections per vertical based on the intellectual need of the ARDC:

1. The DAOAdvocate;
2. Risk Management-Oriented Member;
3. Security-Oriented Member;
4. Research-Oriented Member.

The following timeline governs an election process that starts at time T \[‘T’ means the date that the on-chain vote passes +3 days]:

**Checks & Balances**

The ARDC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ARDC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.

The Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:

Appointment & Termination: ARDC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.

* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:

*“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \[*[*$2.03 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan 1*](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)*].*

* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:

*““ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at* [*The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3*](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) *(as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:*

*1.* [*Snapshot*](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) *(or any successor thereto); or*

*2. another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.*""

**Conflict of Interest Provision**: ARDC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.

To sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.

**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.

**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).

**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.

**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.

**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.

**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.

**Operational parameters to be implemented**

* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;
* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;
* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;
* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.

We believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Multi-Sig]**

The ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:

* Sam \[Gains Network]
* Matt \[StableLab]
* ImmutableLawyer \[Axis Advisory]
* Max \[Connext]
* Brian \[Gamma Strategies]

The ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:

* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.
* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.

**The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ARDC Multi-Sig via the Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ARDC \[Clawback Capability]:** [**Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \[Clawback Capability\]**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)

**In addition, after the ARDC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ARDC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.**

**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \[Term]**

The duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums."

# Final Version with Option 2 (Karma)

## Abstract

We introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*

## Motivation

This proposal is the final result of the proposal published and voted in favor of option 2 in snapshot. It contains some minor changes.

* [Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/19467)

# **Spec: Delegate Incentive System**

## Duration of the Incentive System

We've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.

## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives

We have set the number of eligible delegates to **50**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a good starting point, these ranking is based on the score they achieve each month.

## Funding

* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives
* 30,000 ARB Karma development
* 20,000 ARB Admin costs
* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers

**Total costs: 1,580,000 ARB**

## **Delegate Selection Process**

### Requirements

Based on the feedback received, we've opted for a single-tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:

* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).
* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.
* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).
* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%

> **Note:**\* So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\* The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\* Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:1.

### Incentive Program Application

Delegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 14-day application window.

**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**

* Forum Username (Link):
* Twitter Profile (Link):
* Snapshot Profile (Link):
* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):

> **Note:**\* Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\* Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.

**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**

## Scoring and Framework

To determine which delegates will be paid monthly, we will use a point system and a framework. Please note that this framework will be developed by Karma. Delegates can track their activities using this template.

### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas

We explain in detail the framework and points system:

* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives
* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table <https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power>
* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment
* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.
  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. Karma pulls the participation activity directly from onchain transactions. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.
    * **PR% formula: (PR \* 20) / 100**
  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.
    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.
    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.
    * **SV% formula: (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) \* 15**
  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.
    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.
    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.
    * **TV% formula: (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) \* 25**
  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.
    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.
    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.
    * **CR% formula: (CR(Rn) / CR(Tn)) \* 25**
  * **Commenting Proposal (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.
    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.
    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.
    * **CP% formula: (CP(Rn) / CP(Tn)) \* 15**
  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month
* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.
  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**
* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.
  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 \* TP% / 100))**

### Parameter summary

* **Activity Weight (%):**
  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**
  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**
  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**
  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**
  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**
  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**
* **Total Participation (TP):**
  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %CP + BP**

### Weight and activity considerations

The activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.

We have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.

**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**

> **Note:**
> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.

### Total Participation (TP)

The 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.

Should more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.

If fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated

> **Note:**
> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.

### Bonus Point

Should a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.

We understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions

* Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?
* Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?
* Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?
* Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).
* Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no?

When evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.

### Parameter Snapshot

When we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.

### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities

On the last day of each month, the incentive system administrator is responsible for collecting and carefully reviewing the data provided by Karma. During this initial stage, several inconsistencies are likely to be identified and corrected. Subsequently, the administrator should announce on the forum the names of the delegates selected to receive incentives, as well as the amounts allocated to each. This procedure must be completed within 10 days.

After the publication of these results, the delegates will have a period of 2 days to present any dispute, in case they disagree with the amounts or the selection made.

### Dispute

Delegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.

To raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:

* Title: Dispute
* Username
* Reason for dispute (be detailed)

The system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.

#### Incentive System Ban

Should a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.

We must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success.

### Payment Execution

If all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be executed from the programs multisig, with full details of the payments posted on the forum, between the 13th and 14th. This will be repeated for the duration of the program.
**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**

## Incentive system administrator

Given the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the administration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.

However, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.

For the administration of said program, the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and it will be managed from the DAOs multisig.

# **Karma automation for the delegate incentive program**

### Features summary

Karma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. They have committed themselves to incorporating any modification to the dashboard, understanding the experimental nature of this program. The features that will be built include:

1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.
2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.
3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.
   **Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**
4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.
5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.

**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**

### Timeline

* **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.
* **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features
* **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.
* **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.

### Payment Schedule

* **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.
* **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on the successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)
* **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)

**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**

## Multisig Management

Since it would be very complicated to KYC 50 delegates (or more) for this program, and following the Foundation's recommendation, we're going to proceed with a multisig to manage payments.

We propose to use a configuration similar to that of [Plurality Labs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976#multisig-management-13). Having a 3/5 multisig where apart from myself, there would be a mix of DAO delegates + contributors, each receiving a 1,000 ARB payment per month for the duration of the program and said signers would be required to undergo a KYC process.

#### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module

* DAO can clawback funds from multisig directly to its treasury with a vote
* Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers
* This multisig will be configured with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally.

#### Signatories

We propose that the signatories be:

* @Frisson
* @dk3
* @JoJo
* @0xWenMoon
* @cattin

## **SEED Latam Commitment**

Seed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.

We will also assume the responsibilities of the incentive system administrator, as mentioned in the previous points.

### Disclaimer

SEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma, nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.

The only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

# Overview

**Duration of the incentive system**

* 6 month

**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**

* 50 delegates

**Selection process**

* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).
* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.
* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).
* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%

*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*

## Key Points

**Scoring**

* Karma Delegate Dashboard

**Minimum score to receive incentives**

* TP= +60%

**Bonus Point**

* +30% TP

**Parameter Snapshot**

* Last day of the month 23:59 UTC

**Dispute**

* 2 days

**Payments**

* On the 13th-14th of each month from the multisig.

**Incentive system administrator**

* SEED Latam / Any delegate or entity willing to collaborate

### Total Cost: 1,580,000

* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives
* 30,000 ARB Karma development
* 20,000 ARB Admin costs
* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers

> **Note**
> Costs may vary since we probably won't give the max amount to every delegate every month, so the cost mentioned would be the max this program would cost assuming we compensate 50 delegates per month for 6 months with the maximum allocation.

## Reports

SEEDLatam commits to delivering two reports, one after the third month and one after the sixth (and final) month of the program with metrics on its impact, delegates' performance, and expenditures. They will also collect feedback from both the community and participating delegates.

*The reports will be a detailed forum post and also accompanied by a community call explaining the metrics and feedback collected.*

**ArbitrumDAO has the power to:**

* Change the direction or parameters of the program when it deems necessary, with a snapshot vote.
* Terminate the program at any time, with a snapshot vote.

## Conclusions

Please note that this initial incentive system is experimental and is not intended to be the final version. With this initiative, we aim to evaluate the performance of the DAO and determine its impact. We also anticipate collaboration from both the DAO and facilitators to ensure its success.

At the end of the six months, SEED Latam commits to delivering a report containing the gathered data and feedback from the governance.

## Modifications introduced post-snapshot

* Karma integration (since option 2 won)
* One additional parameter to include forum activity
* Multisig since it would be operationally unviable to KYC every delegate"

# Final Version with Option 2 (Karma)

## Abstract

We introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*

## Motivation

This proposal is the final result of the proposal published and voted in favor of option 2 in snapshot. It contains some minor changes.

# **Spec: Delegate Incentive System**

## Duration of the Incentive System

We've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.

## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives

We have set the number of eligible delegates to **50**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a good starting point, these ranking is based on the score they achieve each month.

## Funding

* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives
* 30,000 ARB Karma development
* 20,000 ARB Admin costs
* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers

**Total: 1,580,000 ARB**

## **Delegate Selection Process**

### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities

On the last day of each month, the incentive system administrator is responsible for collecting and carefully reviewing the data provided by Karma. During this initial stage, several inconsistencies are likely to be identified and corrected. Subsequently, the administrator should announce on the forum the names of the delegates selected to receive incentives, as well as the amounts allocated to each. This procedure must be completed within 10 days.

After the publication of these results, the delegates will have a period of 2 days to present any dispute, in case they disagree with the amounts or the selection made.

### Dispute

Delegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.

To raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:

* Title: Dispute
* Username
* Reason for dispute (be detailed)

The system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.

#### Incentive System Ban

Should a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.

We must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success.

### Payment Execution

If all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be executed from the programs multisig, with full details of the payments posted on the forum, between the 13th and 14th. This will be repeated for the duration of the program.
**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**

#### Considerations

Like every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).

## Incentive system administrator

Given the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the administration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.

However, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would provide any assistance necessary.

For the administration of said program the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates.

# **Karma automation for the delegate incentive program**

### Features summary

Karma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. Given the experimental nature of this program, they have committed to implementing any modification necessary to the program, including new parameters. The features that will be built include:

1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.
2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.
3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.
   **Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**
4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.
5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.

**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**

### Timeline

* **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.
* **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features
* **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.
* **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.

### Payment Schedule

* **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.
* **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on the successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)
* **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)

**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**

## Multisig Management

Since it would be very complicated to KYC 50 delegates (or more) for this program, and following the Foundation's recommendation, we're going to proceed with a multisig to manage payments.

We propose to use a configuration similar to that of [Plurality Labs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976#multisig-management-13). Having a 3/5 multisig where apart from myself, there would be a mix of DAO delegates + contributors, each receiving a 1,000 ARB payment per month for the duration of the program.

#### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module

* DAO can clawback funds from a multisig directly to its treasury with a vote
* Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers
* This multisig will be configured with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally.

**Zodiac module:** <https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum-delegate-incentives-zodiac-module>

#### Signatories

We propose that the signatories be:

* @Frisson
* @dk3
* @JoJo
* @maxlomu
* @cattin

**Multisig:** 0xff1f38f8cDae7C1B1B289FCF6f5C1AA234DF1443

## **SEED Latam Commitment**

Seed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.

We will also assume the responsibilities of the incentive system administrator, as mentioned in the previous points.

### Disclaimer

SEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.

The only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

# Overview

**Duration of the incentive system**

* 6 month

**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**

* 50 delegates

**Selection process**

* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).
* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.
* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).
* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%

*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*

## Key Points

**Scoring**

* Karma Delegate Dashboard

**Minimum score to receive incentives**

* TP= +60%

**Bonus Point**

* +30% TP

**Parameter Snapshot**

* Last day of the month 23:59 UTC

**Dispute**

* 2 days

**Payments**

* On the 13th-14th of each month from a multisig.

**Incentive system administrator**

* SEED Latam / Any delegate or entity willing to collaborate

### Total Cost: 1,580,000

* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives
* 30,000 ARB Karma development
* 20,000 ARB Admin costs
* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers

> **Note**
> Costs may vary, since we probably won't give the max amount to every delegate every month, so the cost mentioned would be the max this program would cost assuming we compensate 50 delegates per month for 6 months with the maximum allocation.

## Reports

SEEDLatam commits to deliver two reports, one after the third month and one after the sixth (and final) month of the program with metrics on its impact, delegates' performance, and expenditures. They will also collect feedback from both the community and participating delegates.

*The reports will be a detailed forum post and also accompanied by a community call explaining the metrics and feedback collected.*

**ArbitrumDAO has the power to:**

* Change the direction or parameters of the program when it deems necessary, with a snapshot vote.
* Terminate the program at any time, with a snapshot vote.

## Conclusions

Please note that this initial incentive system is experimental and is not intended to be the final version. With this initiative, we aim to evaluate the performance of the DAO and determine its impact. We also anticipate collaboration from both the DAO and facilitators to ensure its success.

At the end of the six months, SEED Latam commits to delivering a report containing the gathered data and feedback from the governance.

## Modifications introduced post-snapshot

* Karma integration (since option 2 won)
* One additional parameter to include forum activity
* Multisig since it would be operationally unviable to KYC every delegate"

**Abstract** - The ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is tasked with facilitating & administering various procurement frameworks within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, creating new procurement frameworks for DAO Ratification & creating a proposal for security-service subsidies.

**Motivation** - Implementing the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) and its associated frameworks is essential for the Arbitrum community as it ensures a transparent, efficient, and accountable approach to procurement, benefiting the ecosystem by securing high-quality service providers via a preemptive quality assurance mechanism which is the procurement framework.

**Rationale** - the ADPC will play a pivotal role in achieving further organization within the ArbitrumDAO. The mandate of the ADPC aims to create an optimal organizational framework for service procurement while also creating a marketplace for service providers that would have gone through preemptive quality assurance.

**Steps to Implement** - The AIP passed Snapshot on the 9th of January 2024. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP is now proceeding to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the ADPC. Once the forecited steps are concluded the election process will commence.

Specifications & Timeline - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.

**Overall Cost** - For a 6-month term, $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month) & 1,000ARB per Multi-sig member \[per month]

**The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be 200,000ARB (a buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC Multi-sig is still able to satisfy payments to procurement committee members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury)**

Executive Summary

This proposal intends to formalize a structured group within the ArbitrumDAO (the ‘ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee’ or ‘ADPC’) responsible for overseeing and managing Procurement Frameworks that are ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time depending on the needs of the organization. The ADPC’s primary purpose is to ensure that procurement activities are conducted efficiently, transparently, and in compliance with the applicable framework/s.

**Overview**

The ADPC’s immediate mandate will be that of facilitating & administering the recently ratified ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ \[REF:[Proposal \[Non-Constitutional\]: \*\*Procurement Framework \[Security Service Providers\]\*\* 15](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704) & [Snapshot 11](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. This mandate can be supplemented by virtue of a Snapshot vote whereby the ArbitrumDAO may add another procurement framework that the Procurement Committee will be responsible to administer & facilitate.

Composition of the ADPC \[Mandate, Eligibility, Election Process, Funding, Operational Parameters]

**\[i] MANDATE**

1. The primary mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is to oversee and facilitate the recently ratified procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as per the following reference: \[Snapshot Proposal Link: [Snapshot 11](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.
2. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.
3. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project’s eligibility for the ‘Subsidy Fund’ referred to in point \[b] above. This ‘Means Test’ (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in \[b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.
4. The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.
5. The ADPC will be tasked with creating & communicating guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes & circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.

**Steps \[2], \[3] & \[4] of the mandate will necessarily have to be coupled with a 14-day consultation period pre-structuring so that input is solicit from the ArbitrumDAO and other relevant third-parties. The input collated during the public consultation period will necessarily need to be made public.**

The ADPC will be composed of three \[3] members that will facilitate & administer procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The appointment of ADPC members will be effected via an open election process via Snapshot’s weighted voting system; wherein the first three \[3] ranked members in the vote will be elected to the ADPC. Albeit not legally binding, when voting for prospective members of the ADPC, delegates & token holders alike should prioritize the following eligibility criteria so as to properly equip the ADPC to carry out its mandate.

**\[iii] ELECTION PROCESS**

We propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ADPC Members \[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 5](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)]. Hereunder, we propose an adapted model of Section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to implement in the ADPC Elections.

The ADPC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the ratification of the on-chain proposal that will secure the funding for the ADPC.

The date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has been finalized.

All ADPC committee members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ADPC \[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions in the Checks & Balances section].

There will be one election with the first three \[3] ranking members in the weighted voting Snapshot being elected to the ADPC.

**\[iv] PROCEDURE & ELECTION TIMELINE**

1. Application Submission (T+7 business days):

Anyone may submit an application on a dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums in conformity with the application template stipulated hereunder;

1. KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period (7 business day period following the end of Application Submission Period):

Applicants who would have validly submitted their applications in conformity with the application template will then be required to undergo KYC/KYB processes. All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates who fail the compliance process. Only applicants who pass KYB/KYC will be eligible for the ADPC election.

1. Member election (7 business day period following the end of KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period):

A Snapshot with weighted voting will be put up, including the list of all eligible candidates. The three \[3] highest voted candidates will be elected to the Procurement Committee.

The ArbitrumDAO may approve and implement a Non-Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future ADPC elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.

**\[vi] FUNDING, TERM & OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS**

**FUNDING**

Elected members of the ADPC will receive a comprehensive compensation package as part of their service during their 6-month term. This package includes a monthly stipend of $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month) to support them in their roles and responsibilities within the ADPC.

**TERM**

The duration of the ADPC’s mandate will be of 182 days \[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal that funds the ADPC is approved by the ArbitrumDAO.

**OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS**

* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;
* Monthly report detailing performance of the ADPC;
* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ADPC;
* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ADPC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.

We believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ADPC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ADPC progress. These dashboard will also grant applicants going through the procurement process insight into internal timelines & progress, thus ensuring a high degree of transparency operationally.

**ADPC \[Multi-Sig]**

The ADPC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:

* DisruptionJoe \[Plularity Labs]
* [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) \[Premia Finance]
* [@limes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/limes)
* [@KlausBrave](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave)
* Dan \[Vela]

The ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:

The ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and members elected:

* Streaming of funds to elected members through Hedgey on a monthly basis. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote as the ArbitrumDAO will be made the Grant Admin on the Hedgey module.
* Clawback capability as explained hereunder.

The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ADPC Multi-Sig via the [Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ADPC.](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability)

In addition, after the ADPC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ADPC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.

**CHECKS & BALANCES**

The ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.

The Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:

Appointment & Termination: ADPC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.

* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:

“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \[[$2.03 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan 1](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)].

* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:

“ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 5](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) (as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:

1. [Snapshot 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) (or any successor thereto); or
2. another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.

Conflict of Interest Provision: ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.

To sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.

Mandate & Purpose of the ADPC: The ADPC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ADPC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ADPC Mandate objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal.

Record-keeping and Reporting: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.

Duty of Impartiality: ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.

Obligation of Recusal: ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.

Prohibition of Self-Dealing: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.

Ethical Trading: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.

# Abstract

This AIP establishes a Long-term Term Incentives Pilot Program for the DAO to test new incentive designs and answer the necessary questions to ensure we are ready to commit to the long-term program. This Pilot Program will distribute a maximum of 45M ARB to protocols building on Arbitrum that were not funded during STIP or the Backfund. The program will distribute ARB to protocols for 12 weeks.

# Motivation

### Testing Incentives Mechanisms For a Long-Term Framework

The Arbitrum DAO has spent the last few months experimenting with incentive programs to attract new users and liquidity to Arbitrum. There is a consensus the DAO will use what we learn from these short-term programs to establish a long-term framework. While STIP V1 brought tons of attention to Arbitrum and has resulted in [upticks 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview) in protocol metrics, we have learned there were many flaws with the structure of STIP Round 1. This Pilot Program looks to implement new mechanisms to address the issues seen during STIP. The DAO will use this Pilot Program as a test run for a long-term framework before committing to a year-long program.

The Pilot Program will operate using a Council, have Advisors to ensure protocols receive adequate feedback and assistance, and allow protocols more freedom to create innovative ARB incentive plans. We believe these changes will help remedy many of the pain points seen in Round 1. Running the Pilot Program to test these new features will allow the DAO to compare different program methods before implementing a long-term framework beginning in Q2 2024. This will help ensure we have all the knowledge necessary to implement the most effective long-term incentives program for Arbitrum.

### Why Protocols Need a Round 2

STIP was an experimental program to distribute ARB to protocols to use as incentives for their users. While it was initially intended to have two rounds, the program was substantially more popular than expected, and the entire 50M ARB budget was used in Round 1 and an additional 21.4M ARB was passed through STIP Backfund for teams that were “approved but not funded”.

This meant no funds remained for Round 2, leading to its cancellation. Many protocols either missed the Round 1 deadline, intentionally waited for Round 2 or simply did not know about STIP. This left several protocols with no alternative route to apply for ARB incentives.

Many STIP Round 1 grantees have seen [upticks 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview) in their metrics. This Pilot Program would allow protocols that missed out on Round 1 the opportunity to apply to gain these benefits, which will help level the playing field for these protocols. The Pilot Program will replace a round 2 and will be funded with 45M ARB to accommodate the large expected protocol demand we have already seen. This will complete the incentivizing of Arbitrum-based teams to create a holistic competitive edge not against each other but against other chains.

# Rationale

There is a DAO consensus that Arbitrum will need a long-term incentive program in 2024. However, many delegates feel the DAO is moving too quickly and spending too much money on backfund or V2 proposals without yet receiving any of the data on STIP’s effectiveness.

We have learned a lot from STIP and can use what went wrong in STIP and the Backfund to hypothesize what changes would create a better long-term framework. However, we have little evidence to prove these new ideas would be a better solution. DAO members currently don’t have the resources or funds to create a long-term program, nor do we understand what a good long-term program looks like.

This proposal focuses on obtaining this evidence using a committed working stream to guarantee we come away from this program ready to make informed decisions on a long-term framework. The pilot program also allows the DAO to test new aspects of an incentive program such as Advisors, Councils, and more flexible incentive distributions before committing long-term.

This will help save the DAO money and time in the long term by preventing the need for more short-term programs before we are ready to commit to the Long-Term Framework.

# Specifications

## Problem / Solutions:

The specifications of the Pilot Program were designed to remedy the 3 largest complaints regarding STIP. The Pilot Program hopes to be a test run for these additions for the DAO to determine if they should also be included in the long-term framework.

#### Problem #1: Too large a burden placed on delegates

In the original STIP, delegates voted on each incentive proposal individually, with almost 100 snapshot votes. This was extremely tiring for delegates and left many feeling they could not make informed decisions on every proposal.

#### Solution #1: Elected council

To remedy this problem, the Pilot Program will have a 5 person council elected by the DAO responsible for evaluating applications and selecting which protocols will advance to a snapshot vote to receive ARB. This will ensure all applications are thoughtfully evaluated with only the most deserving receiving incentives. Not only will this help to reduce the burden on delegates, but it will also help expedite the process and allow protocols to receive incentives quickly and efficiently.

#### Problem #2: Protocols did not receive adequate feedback on their proposals

A major gripe from protocols was they struggled to get feedback from delegates before the deadline. This left many feeling as though the better-connected protocols had an advantage as they were able to modify their proposals based on feedback to make them more competitive during the vote. Many protocols were willing to make changes to their applications to make them more appealing to the DAO but never received the proper feedback necessary to do so.

#### Solution #2: Advisors

The Pilot Program introduces Advisors to assist protocols throughout the pilot program. This will be impartial organizations tasked with providing each applicant with detailed feedback and guidance on how to improve their applications and eventually their incentive programs. This ensures each applicant can iterate on their proposal so they can put forward the best possible incentive plan for the council.

#### Problem #3: Strict Limitations on Incentives Mechanisms

STIP Round 1 had strict limitations on how the ARB could be used as incentives. This was done to protect the DAO and prevent misuse of funds. However, the strict rules resulted in the stifling of many innovative incentive designs. Many protocols had interesting designs that used the ARB in ways that increased alignment, improved cost efficiency, or helped to limit the dumping of ARB. However, these designs were not permitted in Round 1 leading to almost all protocols resulting in generic liquidity incentive models.

#### Solution #3

The Pilot Program provides more flexibility to protocols to create innovative incentive structures. With the addition of the Council and Advisors, the Pilot Program does not require the rules to be as stringent. Malicious or inefficient designs will be first filtered out by the Advisors and then rejected by the council. Allowing protocols to innovate on incentive distribution mechanisms will allow Arbitrum protocols and community members to get a better idea of which designs work and which don’t work. This will help everyone as we prepare for a longer-term incentives program.

## Flow of Pilot Program

#### Application Period (2 week)

Protocols will have 2 weeks to apply using the Pilot Program application template. The application template will be created by the Council and the Advisors to ensure everyone has the same goals and make it easier for the council to process applications. Applications will be posted in the Pilot Program section of the Arbitrum forum. Protocols only need to post the initial draft of their application during this period. They will then have 2 additional weeks during the feedback period to edit their applications. No late submissions will be accepted.

#### Feedback Period (2 weeks)

During the feedback period, the Applications Advisors will provide feedback and guidance on all proposals. Protocols will be assigned an Application Advisor who will provide feedback and guidance on applications on a rolling basis. Protocols will then use this time to work with the Advisors to edit their proposals before applications lock at the end of the 2 weeks.

Protocols can continuously adjust their requested ARB amounts until the feedback period is finished. No changes can be to the requested ARB amount during the screening period.

StableLab will also read all submissions during this period and highlight any rule violations to allow applicants to edit their submissions to ensure they comply with all program rules.

#### Screening Period (1 week)

During this period, the council will use the pre-determined rubric to grade each protocol and decide which protocols will advance to the voting period to receive ARB. The Council will use the rubric to select which applications will progress to a snapshot vote. The protocols that the council selects to advance to a snapshot vote must have a total funding amount that is equal to or lower than the incentives budget. This will ensure the DAO does not overspend should all Snapshot votes pass. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.

The rubric will be created by the Council and Advisors during the Tally voting period and will be publicly available by the time protocols begin to apply. The council will be required to publish a brief reasoning for all of their decisions on the forum to create transparency and accountability.

The council must judge applications as they are and cannot accept protocols at lower amounts than their application states. For example, if an application asks for 200,000 ARB the council can not fund them with 100,000 ARB

EXAMPLE: This is a hypothetical example using a budget of 10 ARB with 50 applicants that each request 1 ARB

50 protocols apply requesting 1 Arb Each → Council grades all 50 applications using the rubric and narrows the selection down to the top 10 applicants to not exceed the budget → 10 snapshot votes are created to allow the DAO to confirm the council’s decisions → 9/10 Snapshot votes receive a majority of “fund” votes → 9 protocols are funded with 1 ARB each and 1 Arb is returned to the DAO

#### Voting Period (1 Week)

Upon completion of the preliminary applicant screening process by the council, the selected applications will be formally presented to the DAO for consideration. Each application will then be subject to a voting process via Snapshot, allowing Arbitrum delegates to vote on the allocation of funds.

#### Compliance Period (3 weeks)

All protocols that successfully pass the voting period will undergo a KYC period during these three weeks. Arbitrum Foundation members will reach out to coordinate these KYCs. All protocols will be required to complete the KYC during this period or they may be disqualified from receiving funds.

Once all KYCs are completed, there will be one vote to ratify the DAOs selection of screened and KYC’d protocols. In the event that the Snapshot vote is favorably concluded, protocols will commence receiving its funding through an Hedgey stream, facilitated by oSnap execution.

#### Incentives Period (12 weeks)

Selected protocols will receive their requested ARB using bi-weekly Hedgey streams for 12 weeks. During this time, protocols will be required to provide bi-weekly updates on the progress of their incentives using a template created by the Council and Advisors. Protocols will be required to finish their incentive distributions or return any unused funds two weeks after their final disbursement is available.

During this period Advisors will continue to work with the protocols to help them analyze and improve their distribution mechanisms. Protocols will be allowed to adjust their incentive plans as long as they do not violate any rules and provide their updated plans in their next bi-weekly update.

## Roles & Responsibilities

### The Council

The council will comprise 5 members. These members should be unbiased and knowledgeable builders, delegates, or organizations with experience in incentive programs, grants councils, or growing a protocol.

The council will decide which protocols will progress to a snapshot vote to be awarded the ARB incentives. The council **does not need to spend** the entire incentives budget should they feel there are not enough quality applications. **Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO to be used in the Long Term Framework.**

The council members will be responsible for creating a rubric that all protocols will be judged against. The council will design this rubric with input from the Advisors and will communicate what they are looking for with the Advisors to ensure the Advisors guide protocols in the right direction. The highest-scoring protocols will progress to Snapshot votes to allow the DAO to determine if they should receive ARB. The council will be responsible for publishing the graded rubrics as well as a brief explanation for all decisions.

The council will also be responsible for determining when to halt a protocol’s stream should they violate program rules or misuse funds. All reports of violations will be evaluated by the council. It will require 4 out of 5 council members to vote in favor of halting the stream for a stream to be stopped. Council members will coordinate with the multi-sig signers to halt a stream. Streams can also be halted via a DAO snapshot vote should the DAO disagree with the council’s judgment.

#### Council Not required to Use entire 45M ARB Budget

While 45 million was the DAO’s [selected budget](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8112be08246466f870d0b91590fe99211f73d15cfdadac62ff3f1e6b2f74869a), the Council does not need to allocate the full amount. The council is responsible for screening applications and will only progress applications they view as worthy of moving to Snapshot. The total funding amount of applications moved to snapshot can be anywhere between 0 and 45M ARB. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO treasury by the multisig.

#### Council Selecting Research Bounties

The council will create the RFPs for the research bounties.

Each RFP will include the research question that should be answered as well as the maximum budget for the bounty. While there is 200,000 ARB allocated for research bounties the council does not need to allocate the entire budget. Arbitrum delegates will then select who will complete each of these RFPs via a snapshot election.

#### Council Election

The 5 council members have been selected by [DAO vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc2d7ebf5ef78084b26544905fd6febf0b8256293ce7f67a71fdcdefc5e6284a4). The 5 Council Applicants with the most votes were elected to serve on the council for the Pilot Program.

Those who serve on the Pilot Program Council are not guaranteed to be included on a council in the full Long Term Incentives Program. There will be new elections to select council members when it comes time for the full long-term program.

#### Council Members

Council members have been elected via [Snapshot vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc2d7ebf5ef78084b26544905fd6febf0b8256293ce7f67a71fdcdefc5e6284a4) and are listed below.

* GFX Labs
* 404 DAO
* Wintermute
* GMX
* Karel Vuong

#### Council Conflict of Interest

Should a Council member have a conflict of interest with an applicant they may excuse themselves from grading said applicant. A conflict of interest can include an investment or close personal ties to an applying protocol. Should this happen the council member will have to disclose they are not grading and provide a reason.

Should there be a dispute over whether the circumstances qualify as a conflict of interest the other council members will vote on whether or not the situation warrants the council members abstaining from grading that applicant.

#### Removing Council Members

Should the DAO feel a member or members of the council are not fulfilling their duty they may remove them using a snapshot vote.

Anyone with sufficient voting power can initiate a Snapshot poll to remove council member(s). Should the poll receive a majority “remove” votes the council member(s) will be immediately removed.

Should this occur there will then be a week-long application process where replacement council members can apply via the forum. This will be followed by a Snapshot vote to elect replacement member(s)

#### Council Cost Breakdown

Each council seat will receive **25,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.

The council will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize council members to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.

Below is a breakdown of the council’s responsibilities as well as the expected amount of time they will take to complete.

#### Council Responsibilities:

* Design an application template and grading rubric with the help of Advisors
* Grade all protocols against the rubric to determine who will progress to snapshot vote
* Provide public reasoning for all funding decisions made
* Decide whether a protocol’s funding should be halted if they violate the rules or fail to distribute ARB
* Create research bounty RFPs
* Pick retrofunding mechanisms and allocations for the DAO to vote on

### Incentive Advisors

#### Overview

Three Advisors will help protocols design, implement, and iterate their incentive programs. Advisors are integral to the proposal process, serving as impartial entities with DeFi expertise. Their primary function is to provide detailed, unbiased feedback on applications, aiding protocols in refining and improving their submissions.

The Advisors will also work closely with the council to create the application template and grading rubric. This will ensure the council and advisors are on the same page so they can provide the best feedback to applicants and ensure the council understands the details of the incentive mechanisms the Advisors are helping protocols design.

As this is an experimental addition to the incentives framework, having expert advisors working with protocols will help protocols and the DAO understand what is most helpful from an advisor and allow the DAO to adjust the role for the longer-term framework. This will also help protocols design more innovative incentive distribution mechanisms that can be tested to see how effective they are going into a long-term incentives framework.

#### Responsibilities

*Collaboration with Council and Program Manager:* Work jointly to design the application template, KPIs, and a grading rubric, ensuring alignment with council expectations and clarity in the evaluation process.

*Feedback and Recommendations:* Offer detailed feedback on each eligible application assigned to your team during the review period.

*Communication with Applicants:* Engage actively with applicants to streamline the application process, aiding in proposal improvements and clarifications.

*Hosting Office Hours:* Schedule and conduct public office hours 3 times per week while the program is running for protocols to seek advice. This will focus on transparency and accessibility. All interactions during these sessions will be recorded and summarized for everyone. Order of speaking during office hours will be on a first come first serve basis.

#### Expectations

*Impartiality*: Advisors must remain unbiased, especially as they do not have the final say in proposal acceptance. While Advisors will work closely with the council members to create the Rubric, advisors should not interfere with the votes from the council nor guarantee any outcome to projects they speak with.

*Continuous Engagement:* Post-application feedback is crucial, as is ongoing involvement in the later stages of the process, subject to discussion and agreement with relevant parties. There may also be later involvement in the process when the program is running or over.

#### Timeline and Process

*Pre-Application Phase*: Advisors we assist the Council with the design of the application template and grading rubric. Advisors are required to hold open office hours, focusing on guiding applicants in preparing their proposals.

*Application Review Phase*: Each proposal receives at least one detailed feedback report addressing key criteria established by the DAO.

*Post-Application Feedback*: After the submission of proposals, advisors provide insights on the process and suggest improvements for future cycles.

#### Selection and Ratification

Those who serve as a Pilot Program Advisor are not guaranteed to be included onboarded in the full Long Term Incentives Program. There will be new elections to select Advisors when it comes time for the full long-term program.

The Advisors have been elected via [Snapshot vote 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1e5052579c5ed931f90e03e59f34274ba0a006093a6eeeab65e5e4df552668cc) and are listed below.

* JoJo
* SEEDLatam Gov
* Castle Capital

#### Advisor Budgets

Each Advisor will receive **35,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.

The council will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize Advisors to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.

Below is a breakdown of the Advisor’s responsibilities as well as the expected amount of time they will take to complete.

### The Multisig

A new multisig will be created for this program. A few individuals from the original [STIP-ARB multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B) used in Round 1 and the backfund proposal are now serving as council members in LTIPP which could create a conflict of interest. Additionally, a new multisig will help to prevent confusion regarding which funds are from STIP and which belong to LTIPP. Finally, a new multisig reduces redundancy of signers across multiple DAO programs which helps to protect the DAO by increasing decentralization.

The new [multisig 1](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A) will be a ⅗ multisig and include:

1. Lindsey
2. Limes
3. Joseph
4. Bobbay
5. Alex Lumley

Multi-sig address: 0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A

The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO, and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. In LTIPP, the council is responsible for deciding when to halt streams and can coordinate with the multi-sig signers so they can enact this request. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.

The multisig includes two features to ensure the accountability of signers and grantees:

1. Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.
2. Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grant’s duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.

#### Multisig Budget

Each Multisig signer will receive **1,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.

In LTIPP, the council is responsible for deciding when to halt streams. This has decreased a significant amount of the multisig’s workload. Due to this, the budget has been lowered from the STIP budget.

### Program Manager

The Program Manager will be responsible for coordinating between all parties involved to ensure the Pilot Program runs smoothly. They will be available to answer any questions the DAO has regarding the Pilot Program and will publish bi-weekly reports so the community understands the status of the program. This role is designed to add efficiency and clarity to all aspects of the Pilot Program. The Program Manager will have no input into which protocols receive funds. However, they will be responsible for handling any operational tasks that arise throughout the Pilot Program.

Matt from StableLab will act as the program manager. StableLab will function in a similar capacity as they did for STIP Round 1. They will help coordinate between the multisig, council, Advisors, applicants, foundation, and community to ensure the Pilot Program program runs smoothly. StableLab will serve as a neutral party and have no power to decide which protocols receive funding or which streams are halted.

StableLab was responsible for designing this Pilot Program and will continue working on designing a long-term Framework with the help of the incentives working group and the DAO. StableLab will be responsible for publishing a research report on the effectiveness of the Pilot Program and their findings on how it operationally compared to STIP V1.

Should the DAO feel StableLab is not fulfilling their duties as program manager, they may remove them using a snapshot vote. An emergency Snapshot vote will then be used to elect a replacement program manager.

In the Long Term Incentives Framework, this position will be decided by the DAO. However, because the Pilot Program is intended to move quickly, it will continue using StableLab’s services given they have experience from managing STIP V1 and already have knowledge from designing this process.

#### Program Manager Budget and Responsibilities

The Program Manager will receive **70,000 ARB** total streamed biweekly throughout the program.

The Program Manager will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize Advisors to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.

Below is a breakdown of the Program Manager’s responsibilities and the expected amount of time they will take to complete.

### Data and Analytics Provider

#### Overview

The Pilot Program will onboard OpenBlock Labs as a service provider for data and analytics monitoring and reporting.

To optimize each initiative, the DAO must collect and analyze data regarding the efficacy of incentives. For the two prior incentive programs, the DAO has partnered with OpenBlock Labs to provide robust incentive data, which can be found [here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum). In addition to the data, OpenBlock provides biweekly updates to the forum, and has collaborated with dozens of protocols and delegates to share meaningful insights; our most recent analysis can be found [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblock-labs-bi-weekly-stip-efficacy-update-1-19/20759/1).

In the following section, we outline OpenBlock’s scope for the LTIPP.

#### Responsibilities

***Incorporate Past Learnings:*** Collaborate with LTIPP advisors to strategically distribute incentive budgets across categories and protocols, utilizing insights derived from OpenBlock’s STIP efficacy analysis. Our previous endeavors have uncovered millions of dollars in unoptimized spending, and we are confident that OpenBlock is well-positioned to guide the DAO in implementing improvements based on these insights.

To illustrate these insights more vividly, we present two examples of real scenarios within the STIP where OBL’s recommendations could effectively guide substantial capital allocation in a meaningful direction, showcasing the potential ROI of OBL’s work:

***1. Concentration of Rewards:*** A handful of protocols have dispersed the majority of their rewards (50-70% or more) to a small group of users (less than 10). In such cases, the DAO is essentially committing millions of dollars to highly concentrated bets on user acquisition. Frequently, these major stakeholders have vested interests in the protocol, resulting in rewards flowing toward rent-seeking participants. The underlying data is available in the “User Claim Activity” section [here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/claims).
*2. Excessive Spending:* Some protocols have distributed significant rewards without showing substantial additional growth compared to their pre-STIP trajectory, as observed in our competitive analysis control groups. Leveraging the data, OBL can offer insights on optimizing allocations and implementing mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of incentive spending. This includes setting specific performance targets to guide the continued deployment of funds. Since we have already spent a lot of time investing in these relationships with protocols, we are in a prime position to efficiently offer these services. The underlying data is available in the “Protocol Metrics Normalized” section [here 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview).

***Protocol Data Aggregation:*** Interface with each protocol to audit and aggregate data on their KPIs. Monitor efficacy through a diverse set of metrics, mirroring the approach taken in the STIP (such as nominal TVL/volume/fees/DAU growth at the protocol level, normalized by claimed ARB, competitive intelligence, aggregated data at the category and ecosystem levels, etc.). Leverage any additional resources to help teams optimize their incentive mechanisms by building more granular insights. To provide more clarity on the resources required for this section, we have detailed the scope below:

*Protocol-Specific:*

1. Reach out and establish connections with protocols and their data teams.
2. Audit existing queries for accuracy and relevance.
3. Understand the KPIs and metrics associated with their queries.
4. Build new queries or modify existing ones based on identified KPIs.
5. Implement ETL processes. Manage separate ETL streams for teams with data in APIs or other platforms.
6. Create visualizations tailored to each protocol.
7. Collaborate with protocols to appropriately label their contract addresses.
8. Flag any instances of misbehavior to the organizing team.

*Aggregate:*

1. Track the flow of funds within the protocols.
2. Develop aggregate views based on the ecosystem.
3. Conduct competitive intelligence analysis spanning various ecosystems.
4. Generate aggregate views covering all categories within the ecosystems.
5. Research efficacy metrics and establish normalization standards.
6. Compile biweekly reports summarizing findings and insights. Engage with the community and iterate on findings to inform recommendations.

***Making Data Publically Available:*** The Data provider will be responsible for making the data behind each dashboard publicly available. This will ensure those completing the Research Bounties have access to this information so they can provide proper analysis of this data. Easy access to data will allow for the Bounty completers to provide better reports and data visualizations for the community. This provides the DAO with a decentralized method for analyzing and understanding how effective this program is as well as better setting up the DAO for the Long Term Framework.

***Monitor For Misuse of Funds:*** The data provider will monitor data from all funded protocols to detect any misuse of funds. Should they find suspicious activity the data Provider will be responsible for sharing this with the Council.

***Create a Recap Report:*** The Data provider will be responsible for creating a recap report that tells the story of the Pilot Program and breaks down the successes and failures of the different incentive strategies.

***Biweekly updates:*** The data provider will provide biweekly updates of the overall themes, trends, and findings from the program.

***Interface with the council, advisors and protocols:*** The analytics providers have access to a wealth of incentive data, thus they are expected to leverage this data to provide feedback to teams who are designing incentive programs.

***Interface with the research bounties and community:*** The analytics provider should work with the research bounty teams and any interested community members to ensure all data is open source and available for teams to access and interact with.

#### Expectations

Impartiality: The Data Provider must remain unbiased. While the Data providers will not have the power to halt streams themselves, they must be impartial when it comes to reporting the data and examining for any misuse of funds. Any suspicious behavior they find must be communicated to the council for further review.

Continuous Monitoring: The Data Provider must continually update the data to reflect the latest updates. This will ensure the bounty researchers and community have access to the correct information. They also must continually monitor for misuse of funds to allow the council to act quickly should any issues arise

#### Selection and Ratification

This will be an elected position in the long-term program. Additionally, given the long-term framework will have a much larger scope and will include many separate incentive categories, it will most likely require the DAO to onboard multiple different organizations to handle the long-term framework’s data monitoring and reporting. However, because the Pilot Program is intended to move quickly, the Data provider will be selected and ratified by the DAO similar to STIP round 1.

#### Data Provider Budget

The Data and Analytics Provider will receive **100,000 ARB** streamed throughout the program.

For this budget, OpenBlock Labs will commit 3 full-time equivalent data scientists.

During this time they will be responsible for:

* Using the data and learnings they gathered during STIP to:
  * Help the advisors recommend strong incentive ideas to applicants
  * Help inform the council as to what a quality applicant looks like
* Meet with all successful applicants to create public dashboards displaying all required metrics
  * Make the data open source so the research bounty teams have easy access to all data
* Monitor all incentive programs for misuse of funds and report any finding to the council
* Communicate with Research Bounty teams via telegram to ensure they have full access and understanding of the data that has been collected from the protocols
* Provide Bi-weekly updates regarding the progress of the program.
* Creating a final report with recommendations for how to structure future incentive programs.

### Proposal Authors

This proposal has been continuously worked on by the authors since the middle of November after requests from the DAO emerged to create an alternative round 2 of STIP. The protocol authors have drafted the proposal, met with delegates for feedback, presented open workshopping calls, implemented feedback, and progressed the proposal towards a vote for the past few months. This funding section retroactively compensates the proposal authors for the hundreds of hours of work put into creating this proposal.

Below is a breakdown of the three contributors as well as their time commitments over the past few months of creating this proposal.

### Research Bounties

The Pilot Program proposal will include research bounties to ensure the DAO collects sufficient data and draws meaningful conclusions from STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program to help inform the future LTIP design. There will be up to 200,000 ARB available to those who complete bounties.

This process guarantees the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.

The Council will be responsible for creating the research bounties RFPs that will include what question the research should answer as well as a maximum budget.

Some possible questions the bounties could address are:

* Which protocol incentive designs were most effective at attracting sticky users/liquidity?
* What is an appropriate budget for a Long Term Incentives Incentive Program?
* What was more effective the council or delegates voting?
* What category of protocol received the most funding? Were any categories left out?

Note: See more [community-created research buckets in the forum here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/serious-people-research-bounties-for-ltipp/20378)

Researchers will then apply to claim these bounties by providing why they are the best fit to answer the question as well as providing a budget.

The DAO will be responsible for selecting who completes each bounty based on the applicant’s experience and proposed budget.

The 200,000 ARB is the maximum amount spent on research bounties. Should the DAO choose to fund lower budgets, any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.

### Retroactive Community Funding

In STIP Round 1 we saw many community members go above and beyond by providing valuable contributions without any funding. 100,000 ARB will be allocated for retroactive funding to community members who add valuable contributions during the Pilot Program. Earmarking these funds upfront lets people know there will be retro funding which will encourage community members to contribute. This section is intentionally vague to encourage all kinds of community contributions. The DAO will have the final say in how these funds will be used.

The exact methods used to distribute the funds will be selected by the DAO. The council will create a list of possible ways to retroactively distribute funds to those who have contributed to the Pilot Program. The DAO will then vote on which retroactive method(s) should be used. The DAO will also decide on who these retroactive payments will go to.

### Arbitrum Delegates

This program is designed to reduce the large burden delegates faced during STIP round 1. While many of their responsibilities will be taken on by the Council and Advisors, the Arbitrum delegates will still retain the final say in many aspects of this proposal.

Delegates will retain the following powers:

* Elect Council Members and Advisors
* Ratify all additional roles included in this proposal
* Remove any position holder via a snapshot vote should the delegates feel they are not fulfilling their responsibilities
* Vote on all incentive proposals selected by the council.
* Select who fulfills the research bounties
* Select the Method of distributing Retro Funding
* Select who receives retro Funding

## Eligibility Requirements

The pilot program is for protocols that did not receive ARB during STIP or the Backfund. However, protocols that received grants from the Arbitrum Foundation, Questbook’s grant program, or any other Arbitrum Grants program are eligible to receive Pilot Program funding. Additionally, receiving funding from the Pilot Program does not prohibit protocols from applying for funding from other DAO or foundation programs including the Long Term Incentives Program.

#### Additional eligibility requirements

* Grantees must be live on Arbitrum at the time of application
* Grantees must refrain from farming their own incentive programs.
* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.
* Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard.
* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.
* Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.
* Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.
* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.
* Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake Sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.
* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation to receive funds.
* Grantees must apply using the approved program application template

By streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:

* Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantee’s application.
* Failure to comply with data reporting standards.
  * Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams
    * Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.
    * More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.
  * If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.

In that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.

# Steps to Implement

* The Council and Advisors have already started creating the application template and rubric
* When the Tally vote ends the Application period will begin the next business day. Protocols will apply using the application template
* At the same time, applicants will begin the KYC process with the foundation to expedite the process should they receive funding.
* The Advisors and the council will begin providing feedback on proposals on a first come first serve basis.
* Once this proposal passes the on-chain vote, the total amount of ARB will be sent to the [multisig 1](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A).
* During the review period, the Protocols will work with Advisors to improve their applications.
* During the review period, the council begins creating the research bounty questions.
* All protocols that pass through the council screening phase, pass KYC, and sign grant agreements will move to a snapshot.
* Applicants who pass the snapshot will have their streams automatically funded
* Successful applicants will receive incentives for 12 weeks and will provide bi-weekly updates
* The community will vote on who will fulfill the research bounties
* The community will vote on Retrofunding
* After the completion of the program, final reports will be posted to the forum
* Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO

# Overall Cost

### Total Cost: 45,735,000 ARB

* **Incentives**: 45,000,000 ARB. The entire budget does not need to be spent by the council. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO
* **Council Members**: 125,000 ARB - 25,000 ARB each
* **Advisors**: 105,000 ARB - 35,000 ARB each
* **Research Bounties**: 200,000 ARB Total - the exact amount and sizes of specific bounties will be selected by the Council and can be vetoed by delegates.

## Constitutional

## Abstract

This Constitutional AIP proposes improvements to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and the Security Council election process, which include:

* Candidates are given a week to apply for a Security Council position before the nominee selection stage takes place.
* Candidates need to sign a transaction from their EOA (Externally Owned Account) to apply for a Security Council position.
* The ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect these changes as well as correct previous mistakes in wording with regard to timing and quorum.

## Motivation

This AIP aims to improve the election process ensuring that candidates are not overlooked during the nominee selection stage and that candidates stand an equal chance of being nominated to the following stage of the election process, irrespective of when in the registration period they express their interest. It also updates the system so contenders must provide a signed message before running in the elections - this ensures they are able to produce signed messages for the different chains that the Security Council needs the ability to act on.

Issues with the current Security Council election process:

* In the nominee Selection stage, because contender registration and endorsement occur in the same 7-day period, delegates are likely to overlook applications that are submitted at the end of the period. This results in candidates who submit their applications at the start of the period having an unfair advantage, as they are more likely to be endorsed and therefore progress to the next stage.
* Candidates might sign up to the elections using an on-chain smart contract wallet which is not able to produce signatures valid for other ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.
* The constitution does not clearly express the election procedure.

## Specifications

Accordingly, this AIP aims to implement the following changes:

1. A 7-day ‘Contender Submission’ stage before the ‘Nominee Selection’ stage. Accordingly, the duration of the entire election process will increase from 42 days to 49 days.
2. For candidates to apply for a Security Council position, they are required to provide a signed message from their wallet.
3. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to correctly reflect how quorum for proposals (as well as the election process) is handled, which should also take into account ‘abstain’ votes.
4. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect the new format of the Security Council elections.

# Constitutional

# Abstract

This AIP proposes a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including the capability to leverage EIP 4844 to post batches of L2 transactions as Blobs on L1 Ethereum at a cheaper price. The proposal also includes support for most of the changes included in [Ethereum's Dencun upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7569) and 2 improvements to batch posting for Arbitrum One and Nova. The proposed ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will be ready for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain; this proposal concerns the Arbitrum One and Nova chains, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject over in [Arbitrum ArbOs upgrades](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).

This AIP combines following two temperature checks: [AIP: ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas”](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x813a366e287a872ada13d4f8348e771c7aa2d8c3cb00b2be31539ceab5627513) and [AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbecc45a6beb55a708e25195f34db2f5ff757e0da5ff55171ca731b39428e27c3) - both of which have passed.

Please note that ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” is an upgrade that builds upon [ArbOS version 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-11/19696/) which has been adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 20 instead of 12 due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability.

# Changes Included

## 1. Posting batches of transactions as blobs to L1 Ethereum ([EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844))

With ArbOS 20 “Atlas”, any Arbitrum chain that settles on L1 Ethereum will be able to post transactions as either calldata or “blob-data” - the latter of which is to be introduced in EIP-4844 as part of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade.

Some notes on how this is implemented for Arbitrum:

* Applications on Arbitrum will not have to be modified or take any explicit action to get the benefits of using EIP-4844 (i.e. the whole chain opts-in with ArbOS 20 “Atlas”).
* ArbOS 20 “Atlas” adds support for Arbitrum chains to send data in a blob storage format to data availability layers, like L1 Ethereum, that support the blob transaction type. This includes Arbitrum One and Nova. ArbOS 20 “Atlas” does not add support for Arbitrum chains to *receive* data in a blob storage format. This means that any L3 Orbit chain settling to an L2 Arbitrum chain will post data to the underlying L2 Arbitrum chain as calldata. The L2 Arbitrum chain will then be able to post data to a L1 data availability layer like Ethereum using blobs.
* There currently aren't estimates on what the end-user gas savings of using blob data will be yet. This topic is something being actively worked on and monitored. Without mainnet data, the estimates for blob gas prices will not be accurate enough to reliably predict the cost reductions that users will experience - and even with mainnet data, the savings will vary by use case (i.e. no current way to predict the price impacts from all blob gas market participants yet). In general, however, the use of blobs will generally reduce the cost of using Arbitrum L2s.

This AIP includes a number of upgrades that enable Arbitrum chains to utilize EIP-4844:

* Updated Sequencer Inbox contract with new methods allowing the Sequencer to post Arbitrum transactions in blob data.
* Updates to the OneStepProof (OSP) contract to support the new Nitro fraud prover (mentioned above), along with a small patch to the ChallengeManager contract to allow changing the OSP.
* Update to the Nitro fraud prover to support proving additional hashes, i.e., KZG and SHA256 preimages.
* Update to the core Nitro node software to handle parsing chain data from 4844 blobs.

## 2. Enable partial support for Dencun Execution Layer

Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade is technically a combination of two upgrades: one to the Execution Layer and another to the Consensus Layer, named Cancun and Deneb, respectively. While the Consensus Layer upgrades are not applicable to Nitro (since Nitro is Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova’s execution engine), some of the Execution Layer changes are, including [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153) as described above. The full Cancun network upgrade specification for Ethereum can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/1fed0c0074f9d6aab3861057e1924411948dc50b/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/cancun.md).

Nitro’s upgrade to ArbOS 20 adds support for three specific EIPs from Cancun, those being:

* Support the new transient storage EVM opcodes introduced in [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153): `TSTORE` and `TLOAD`, offering a cheaper option than storage for data that’s discarded at the end of a transaction.
* Support the new `MCOPY` EVM opcode introduced in [EIP-5656](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656) for cheaper memory copying.
* Support the changes in functionality of the`SELFDESTRUCT` EVM opcode, as outlined in [EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780).

Since Nitro uses [Geth at the Core](https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#geth-at-the-core), the above 3 EIPs were implemented by merging in a Cancun-supported version of Geth upstream. More specifically, [Geth version 1.13.1](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.13.3) was merged into Nitro’s go-ethereum fork here:

<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/284>

With the above merged, the below PR is used to enable the Cancun fork in ArbOS 20.

<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/285>

## 3. Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix

### **Motivation**

**Batch Poster Manager:**

Currently, both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, each have a single address that is granted the batch-poster role (this is currently the same as the Sequencer). The Sequencer posts batches frequently, and thus the batch-poster address must be controlled by a hot wallet. This means that if the batch poster’s keys were compromised, Sequencing could be unstable until the DAO took action.

This AIP proposes a system in which a “batch poster manager” role is granted to the operator of the Sequencer which has the ability to grant and revoke batch-posting affordances. This way, the batch poster manager could perform key rotations for the batch posters— routinely, and/or if a batch poster address is ever compromised — quickly and without the DAO needing to take coordinated action. Note that this proposal does not change the sequencer, but more so allow for easier key rotations on the batch poster.

Crucially, this would not represent a change on the current system’s trust model:

* In both the current and the new proposed system, the Sequencer is entrusted with managing the batch posting affordance; in the current system, for example, the entity behind Sequencer could technically grant batch posting to an additional entity by simply sharing it’s keys.
* In the new system, the DAO would *still* have the same ability to revoke the Sequencer role; i.e., the DAO could update the batch poster manager (along with any batch posters).

PR: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7>

**MaxTimeVariation:**

The futureBlocks value in the the SequencerInbox enforces a max block height that a batch can be posted relative to the current block (likewise with futureSeconds). The current value for futureBlocks is 12, which was set prior to the Ethereum merge. A small value for future blocks means that a relatively small L1 reorg can cause an otherwise valid batch to revert. This proposal increases the value to 64, two epochs, in line with Ethereum’s finality guarantees.

PR: <https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/233>

### Dencun changes *not* included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”

Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade includes various proposals that impact both the execution layer and the consensus layer, as mentioned earlier. Among the execution layer changes, there are two EIPs that are explicitly not included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”. This section briefly covers the scope of the two excluded EIPs and a rationale for why they are not included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”.

* [**EIP-7516**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7516)**:** `BLOBBASEFEE` **opcode**

This EIP adds a new opcode to the EVM that returns the base fee of the current blob and is identical to the `BASEFEE` opcode introduced in [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198). This is applicable for Ethereum because it enables blob data users, such as rollup contracts or infrastructure, to programmatically account for the blob gas price.

This opcode is excluded from ArbOS 20 “Atlas” because Arbitrum chains are not currently planned to support *receiving* blobs from other chains, like an L3 Orbit chain. Calls to the `BLOBBASEFEE` opcode on Arbitrum One and Nova after the ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will revert.

* [**EIP-4788**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788)**: Beacon block root in the EVM**

This EIP commits a given block’s beacon chain root to the payload header for that particular block as a hash - essentially exposing beacon chain roots to the EVM. This is applicable for Ethereum because it improves the trust assumptions for a variety of applications that rely on data in the consensus layer. Examples of use cases that this would benefit include: staking pool, restaking constructions, smart contract bridges, and more.

This EIP is excluded from ArbOS 20 “Atlas” because Arbitrum’s execution engine (i.e. Nitro) does not have a consensus layer and relies on Ethereum consensus for data security and data finality. Calls to the beacon root opcode on Arbitrum One and Nova after the ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will revert.

# Implementation

The canonical version of ArbOS 20 “Atlas” this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash `cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749` and can be viewed in <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/commit/cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749>.

ArbOS 20 “Atlas” will be shipped as part of a future release of Nitro.

Specifically for the batch poster manager changes, the difference can be found here: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7>

### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference

The current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 11, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v11`git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x8b104a2e80ac6165dc58b9048de12f301d70b02a0ab51396c22b4b4b802a16a4`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.

To audit the code difference from ArbOS 11 to ArbOS 20, you could simply generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 11 or ArbOS 20 with bash:

\#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
mkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output
\# this script should be run in the nitro repository
git checkout cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749
git submodule update --init --recursive
make .make/solgen
go list -f ""{{.Deps}}"" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find ""$dir"" -type f -name '\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\_test\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt
go list -f ""{{.Deps}}"" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do find ""$dir"" -type f -name '\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\_test\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt
git checkout consensus-v11
git submodule update --init --recursive
make .make/solgen
go list -f ""{{.Deps}}"" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find ""$dir"" -type f -name '\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\_test\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v11-nitro-files.txt
go list -f ""{{.Deps}}"" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do find ""$dir"" -type f -name '\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\_test\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v10-geth-files.txt
sort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v11-nitro-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt > ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt
sort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v11-geth-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt | sed 's@^\[./]\*go-ethereum/@@' > ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt

Now, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 11 or ArbOS 20. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:

git diff consensus-v11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)

The fraud prover is not part of the on-chain upgrade, but may be helpful in understanding the fraud proving smart contract changes and other components:

git diff consensus-11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 -- arbitrator/prover arbitrator/wasm-libraries/ arbitrator/arbutil ':!\*\*/Cargo.lock' ':!\*\*/kzg-trusted-setup.json'

For the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 11 and 20 used:

$ git ls-tree consensus-v11 go-ethereum
160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum
$ git ls-tree cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 go-ethereum
160000 commit 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6  go-ethereum

Those commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:

\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder
git diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)

This diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.11.6 and v1.13.3, as ArbOS 11 used the former and ArbOS 20 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: [Git diff intersection finder](https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf)

We can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 20’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 20’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.13.3:

\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder
git diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-20-geth.diff
git diff v1.13.3 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-upstream-geth.diff
diff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-20-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-upstream-geth.diff --ignore-files 'core/blockchain\*.go' arbitrum\_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/\*\*' 'rpc/\*\*'

The above command ignores files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used with these arguments: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`. To also review those diffs, you can remove those arguments.

Note that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag."

## Introduction

Back in August, Arbitrum DAO passed our AIP-3 to build a pluralistic grants framework that decentralizes grants decision-making, avoids capture and scales valuable grants allocations, and grows the Arbitrum ecosystem overall.

Our proposal [passed on Tally](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976) with ~99% of delegate votes. It had overwhelming support, we believe, because you a) trust our motives and capabilities, and b) understand how big and important the problem is:

Nearly every DAO struggles to create sustainable value - largely because DAO decision-making is famously slow, and inefficient, which drives them to compromise their values and centralize. Arbitrum is committed to being better, and you believed in our ability to help.

## Background (Milestone 1a Retrospective)

Across Milestones 1a, we pluralistically deployed funds via 12 different grants programs and different modalities for grants decision-making.

Experimenting with multiple modalities allows us to allocate grants to support quick feedback about what works and can scale now. We can quickly evolve our grants decision making based the below success rubric, which determines where to allocate grants:

* Grow = double-down / start to scale
* Coach = make changes / try again
* Cut = discontinue / recommend to seed program

In Milestone 1a, we seeded the initial 12 Grants Programs. In Milestone 1b, we will lean on our newly established Plurality Labs board (more later!) as well as community voices who can evaluate our grants via our Thrive Protocol to inform where to cut, coach, and grow.

\[Based on our pluralistic grants framework and success criteria, these are the current results of milestone 1 ([details here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/plurality-labs-milestone-1-review/20198/2?u=senad.eth))]

### Milestone 1a Wins include:

* Firestarters: Four proposals passed Snapshot because of our Firestarters program - which funds unbiased research, cat herding, and crafting of proposals crucial to the DAO. These include STIP, ARDC, ARPC, and STEP. ([TNorm talking about our role with STIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAiy5IABZ48b0o-NqVIRcu4_NRuM9vzI/view?usp=sharing))
* Experimenting with Grants Decision-Making Modalities: We drove over 30 experiments in collective decision-making, including proactive and retroactive grant-making, and grant-making driven by experts, expert-counsels, permissionless counsels, random counsels, and direct input mechanisms.
* Retroactive Grants: We drove the first retroactive grants program in Arbitrum, rewarding unpaid contributors, and setting the stage for follow-on experiments. Some of these people are creating obvious value in the ecosystem now, like Atom from castlecap who is now an LTIPP advisor.
* Quadratic Funding: Via Gitcoin, we brought thousands of new users, and hundreds of builders and builder projects to the Arbitrum ecosystem.

### Milestone 1a Lessons:

* Investing in documentation: We funded 250+ projects, and spurred movement all over the DAO. But we didn’t document our work and value well. More importantly, we didn’t deliver certain written deliverables that people in the DAO were expecting on time. It hurt us. We won’t make that mistake again.
* Investing in communications: Our bias was for action. We cared about creating value and learning - and put blinders on for everything else. We should have hired a Marketing or Comms person. We didn’t. Going forward, we’ll button up. We have a good story to tell. We’re excited to tell it.
* Leveraging internal team: Plurality Labs was acquired by ThriveCoin in August of 2023. We have a team of 26 people who support other big ecosystems. We could have leveraged Thrive best practices. But in an effort to stay “true” to the Milestone 1 proposal, we kept the teams separate - too separate. We’ll use all available resources this time.

### Vision

We have a big vision. We’re seeking to build the most robust pluralistic grants ecosystem in DAO history. To do it, we took some big shots on goal in Milestone 1a - funding 12 grant programs using 30 decision making experiments to fund 250+ projects. Some shots scored and others missed.

This is aligned with the expectations of the pluralistic grants approach. The only way to create and scale pluralistic grants is to decentralize bet taking… and to get as comfortable with the shots that embarrassingly fly into the stands as we are with the goals.

We will use data to help us double-down on winners and cut others. With the data we’re collecting, we will create a robust, long-term pluralistic grants framework for Arbitrum DAO. This framework is emerging now, and it will continue to become clearer throughout Milestone 1b(ridge).

## Milestone 1(bridge):

In our maiden proposal, the principal outcome we sought to achieve was to demonstrate that we could deliver and scale enormous value creation via a pluralistic grants framework. The general feedback from delegates has been: kind of…

There seems to be wide agreement that we created value but need to scale,  document, and showcase.

Thus, after consultation with a number of the top delegates, we created this Milestone 1b(ridge) proposal that asks for the exact same amount of ARB and same timeframe as passed with 99% of delegate vote in August.

In Milestone 1b, we will show:

1. We can build on winners and cut underperformers with our initial grants allocations.
2. We can continue to drive experimentation with new grants allocations.
3. We can deliver on all deliverables for Milestone 1 to the satisfaction of our top delegates.
4. We can leverage better tech and systems to support further scale in Milestone 2.

To ensure we achieve these goals, we are implementing best-practices from the Thrive team that, also, are aligned with feedback we received from delegates:

1. Plurality Labs Board: We are welcoming a board of top voices in the Arbitrum community for oversight, and to ensure decentralized decision-making.
2. Human validations: Thrive Protocol allows us to validate when value is created, and pay out funds to projects upon value creation. This is critical for scale. We’ll use it.
3. Team upgrade: We are bringing in the big guns for this one, adding team members that know grants, know DAOs, and know scale.

Here’s more information about our commitments in Milestone 1b(ridge):

Plurality Labs Board: We brought together trusted and known voices in the Arbitrum community. Their role with us is to gather feedback and data from our Arbitrum community, and to make strategic decisions about grants allocators, specific grants / contributions, and validations.

This board is part of this vote. We found people to represent the different stakeholder groups in Arbitrum. Now your votes will ratify this group - which includes two who voted ""No"" to our temp check for Milestone 2!

Human Validations: Going forward, we will fund our grants at specific milestones of value creation. White-listed Arbitrum community members will - in a pluralistic way - help clarify when value is created, and will also be rewarded for their services (more on this later).

Team revamp: We are fully utilizing our 26-person ThriveCoin team), we have also added some key team members to our roster, including: Ben West (GitCoin grants lead), Kyler Wandler (DAO Research Collective), and Scott Mandel (Complex Labs, Flexa, 2Q Ventures).

## Cost

As aligned with the feedback we’ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.

2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework. We are also adding a layer of oversight to our work - welcoming an esteemed Plurality Labs board. They will, among other things, help ensure we deliver the value we promise.

The 560k ARB services fee (same ARB and same buckets as first proposal) includes:

## Impact:

Our intention is for this to be one of the most impactful AIPs in the history of Arbitrum. If we do our work right (and we believe we’re on the right track) we should be spurring thriving, net-positive ecosystem activity in Arbitrum for years to come.

Additionally, we’ll be doing it via a pluralistic grants framework that has a consistent bias for value creation, further decentralization, and resistance to capture. We will be building the future of web3 together, and providing a path for all great people and teams to work with Arbitrum.

When the value of Milestone 1b is obvious, we’ll present Milestone 2."
